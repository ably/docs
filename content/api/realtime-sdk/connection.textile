h2(#properties).
  default: Connection Properties
  swift,objc: ARTConnection Properties
  ruby: Ably::Realtime::Connection Attributes
  java: io.ably.lib.realtime.Connection Members
  csharp: IO.Ably.Realtime.Connection Properties

The @Connection@ object exposes the following public <span lang="default">properties</span><span lang="ruby">attributes</span><span lang="java">members</span>:

h6(#id).
  default: id
  csharp: Id

A unique public identifier @String@ for this connection, used to identify this member in presence events and messages.

h6(#state).
  default: state
  csharp: State

The current <span lang="java">"@io.ably.lib.realtime.ConnectionState@":#connection-state @state@</span><span lang="csharp">"@IO.Ably.Realtime.ConnectionState@":#connection-state @state@</span><span lang="ruby">"@Ably::Realtime::Connection::STATE@":#connection-state @state@</span><span lang="objc,swift">"@ARTRealtimeConnectionState@":#connection-state @state@</span><span lang="default">@state String@</span> of this Connection. See the "@Connection@ states":/connect/states#connection-states for more information.

h6(#error-reason).
  default: errorReason
  java:    reason
  csharp:  ErrorReason
  ruby:    error_reason

When a connection failure occurs this <span lang="default,ruby">attribute</span><span lang="java">member</span><span lang="jsall,csharp">property</span> contains the <span lang="jsall,csharp">"@ErrorInfo@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#error-info</span><span lang="java,ruby">"@AblyException@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#ably-exception</span>.

h6(#key).
  default: key
  csharp:  Key

A unique private connection key @String@ used to recover or resume a connection, assigned by Ably. When recovering a connection explicitly, the <span lang="default">@recoveryKey@</span><span lang="ruby">@recovery_key@</span> is used in the @recover@ "client options":/api/realtime-sdk#client-options as it contains both the @key@ and the last message @serial@.

This private connection key can also be used by other REST clients to publish on behalf of this client. See the "publishing over REST on behalf of a realtime client documentation":/rest/channels#publish-on-behalf  for more info.

h6(#recovery-key).
  default: recoveryKey
  ruby:    recovery_key
  csharp:  RecoveryKey

The recovery key @String@ can be used by another client to recover this connection's state in the <span lang="default">@recover@</span><span lang="csharp">@Recover@</span> "client options":/api/realtime-sdk#client-options <span lang="default">property</span><span lang="java">member</span><span lang="ruby">attribute</span>. See "connection state recover options":/connect/states#connection-state-recover-options for more information.

h6(#serial).
  default: serial
  csharp:  Serial

The serial number @Integer@ of the last message to be received on this connection, used automatically by the library when recovering or resuming a connection. When recovering a connection explicitly, the <span lang="default">@recoveryKey@</span><span lang="ruby">@recovery_key@</span><span lang="csharp">@RecoveryKey@</span> is used in the <span lang="default">@recover@</span><span lang="csharp">@Recover@</span> "client options":/api/realtime-sdk#client-options as it contains both the @key@ and the last message @serial@.

h2(#methods).
  default: Connection Methods
  swift,objc: ARTConnection Methods
  ruby: Ably::Realtime::Connection Methods
  java: io.ably.lib.realtime.Connection Methods
  csharp: IO.Ably.Realtime.Connection Methods

h6(#connect).
  default: connect
  csharp: Connect

bq(definition).
  default: connect()
  ruby:    "Deferrable":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable connect -> yields "@Connection@":/api/realtime-sdk/connection
  java:    void connect()
  csharp:  void Connect()
  flutter: Future<void> connect()

Explicitly calling <span lang="default">@connect@</span><span lang="csharp">@Connect@</span> is unnecessary unless the "@ClientOptions@":#client-options attribute <span lang="default">@autoConnect@</span><span lang="ruby">@auto_connect@</span><span lang="csharp">@AutoConnect@</span> is @false@. Unless already @connected@ or @connecting@, this method causes the connection to open, entering the @connecting@ state.

blang[ruby].
  h4. Returns

  A "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable object is returned from this method.

  On successfully connecting to Ably, the registered success blocks for the "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable and any block provided to this method yields a "@Connection@":/api/realtime-sdk/connection object.

  Failure to connect will trigger the errback callbacks of the "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable with an "@ErrorInfo@":#error-info object containing an error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.

blang[flutter].
  h4. Returns

  @Future<void>@

  Failure to connect will throw an @AblyException@ with an "@errorInfo@":#error-info property containing an error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.

h6(#close).
  default: close
  csharp: Close

bq(definition).
  default: close()
  ruby:    "Deferrable":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable close -> yields "@Connection@":/api/realtime-sdk/connection
  java:    void close()
  csharp:  void Close()
  flutter: Future<void> close()

Causes the connection to close, entering the @closing@ state. Once @closed@, the library will not attempt to re-establish the connection without an explicit call to <span lang="default">"@connect()@":#connect</span><span lang="csharp">"@Connect()@":#connect</span><span lang="ruby">"@connect@":#connect</span>.

blang[ruby].
  h4. Returns

  A "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable object is returned from this method.

  On successfully closing the connection, the registered success blocks for the "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable and any block provided to this method yields a "@Connection@":/api/realtime-sdk/connection object.

  Failure to close the connection will trigger the errback callbacks of the "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable with an "@ErrorInfo@":#error-info object containing an error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.

h6(#on).
  default: on
  csharp: On

There are <span lang="jsall">three</span><span lang="default">two</span> overloaded versions of this method:

bq(definition#on-state-listener).
  default: on(String event, listener("ConnectionStateChange":#connection-state-change stateChange))
  ruby:    on("ConnectionEvent":#connection-event *event) -> yields "ConnectionStateChange":#connection-state-change
  java:    void on("ConnectionEvent":#connection-event event, "ConnectionStateListener":#connection-state-listener listener)

  flutter: Stream<"ably.ConnectionStateChange":#connection-state-change> on("ably.ConnectionStateChange":#connection-state-change stateChange)

<div lang="flutter">
The Stream returned can be subscribed for with a listener.

bq(definition). final streamSubscription = stream.listen(listener)

</div>
Register the given listener <span lang="ruby">block</span><span lang="swift,objc">function</span><span lang="csharp">action</span> for the specified "@ConnectionEvent@":#connection-event on the @Connection@. The listener is passed a "ConnectionStateChange":#connection-state-change object that contains the current state, previous state, and an optional reason for the event or state change.</span>

<div lang="jsall">
bq(definition). on(String[] events, listener("ConnectionStateChange":#connection-state-change stateChange))

blang[ruby].
  h4. Returns

  A "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable object is returned from this method.

  On successfully echoing a heartbeat from Ably, the registered success blocks for the "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable and any block provided to this method yields a @Float@ representing the time in seconds for the heartbeat ping request to be echoed.

  Failure to receive a heartbeat ping will trigger the errback callbacks of the "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable with an "@ErrorInfo@":#error-info object containing an error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.
