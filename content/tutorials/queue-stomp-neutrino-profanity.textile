"Ably Reactor Queues":https://www.ably.io/reactor are traditional message queues that provide a reliable and straightforward mechanism for customers to consume, process, store, augment or reroute data from our realtime platform efficiently by your servers.

In this tutorial we will show you how to:

* Provision a "Reactor Queue":/general/queues and set up a queue rule to republish messages from a channel into the queue
* Create a simple Express.js web server to serve up the web app and issue authentication tokens for the Realtime browser client
* Publish unsafe text from a Realtime browser client to a channel, which is automatically republished by Ably to the provisioned message queue
* Set up a worker server to consume the messages (unsafe text) from the message queue, communicate with the "Neutrino Bad Word Filter API":https://www.neutrinoapi.com/api/bad-word-filter/ to strip out profanities, and publish the safe text as a message back to the client using the REST API
* Subscribe to safe text published from the workers in the web app using a realtime pub/sub channel

The following diagram depicts the architecture for this tutorial:

</a>

The diagram may look complicated, but fortunately getting the app up and running with Ably is not! Let's get started.

h2. Step 2 - Install Ably on your server

To start using Ably on your Node.js server, you first need to install the NPM module. The NPM module can be installed as follows:

```[sh]
  npm install ably
```

The server client library must be instanced with the private API key you copied in Step 1. This will ensure that the "basic authentication scheme":/core-features/authentication#basic-authentication is used, which is almost always the right choice for your own trusted servers where risk of compromise of your API key credentials is low.

Add the following to a file named @server.js@ to instance the Ably library inside your Node.js server:

```[nodejs]
  var Ably = require('ably');
  var rest = new Ably.Rest({ key: ApiKey });
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/neutrino-node-step2

h2. Step 3 - Set up your web server & base app HTML

Before a client connects to Ably, it will check if it has suitable credentials to authenticate with Ably. As we'll be using the recommended "token authentication scheme":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication in the client for this demo, when the client starts up and attempt to connect to Ably, it will request a token immediately so that it can then authenticate with Ably.

As tokens are typically issued from your own web servers, we'll set up a simple web server now for this tutorial and add the base app static HTML and  assets.

"Express.js":https://expressjs.com/ is a very popular and simple web server framework for Node.js. Let's get this setup:

First we'll add the @express@ NPM module and create a @package.json@:

```[json]
{
  "name": "ably-tutorials",
  "repository": "https://github.com/ably/tutorials",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=0.10"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "ably": "~1.0",
    "express": "~4.0"
  }
}
```

Run @npm install@ to install the Node package dependencies.

Then we'll set up a vanilla HTTP Express.js server in @server.js@:

```[nodejs]
  const Express = require('express');
  const ServerPort = 3000;

  /* Start a web server */
  const app = Express();

  /* Server static HTML files from /public folder */
  app.use(Express.static('public'));
  app.listen(3000);

  console.log('Web server listening on port', ServerPort);
```

At this point, you should also create a @public@ folder for your HTML, CSS and JS files and then add "@app.js@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/db6fa91a1241e39b249b405715f4410c411f537d/public/app.js, "@index.html@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/db6fa91a1241e39b249b405715f4410c411f537d/public/index.html and "@style.css@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/db6fa91a1241e39b249b405715f4410c411f537d/public/style.css

If you would like to try running the server now, you can do so with @node server.js@. Once running, open your browser to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ and you should see the base HTML app.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/neutrino-node-step3

h2. Step 4 - Plug in Ably client-side, add auth endpoint and update UI

First let's first make sure the web server is capable of issuing token request to clients that need to authenticate with Ably. If you are unfamiliar with client and server token based authentication with Ably, please see "the client server token auth tutorial":/tutorials/token-authentication.

By adding the following route to your Express.js server, it is now ready to service clients wanting to authenticate with Ably.

```[nodejs]
  /* Issue token requests to browser clients sending a request to the /auth endpoint */
  app.get('/auth', function (req, res) {
    rest.auth.createTokenRequest(function(err, tokenRequest) {
      if (err) {
        res.status(500).send('Error requesting token: ' + JSON.stringify(err));
      } else {
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        res.send(JSON.stringify(tokenRequest));
      }
    });
  });
```

Try running your server again with @node server.js@ and visiting "http://localhost:3000/auth":http://localhost:3000/auth and you should see a JSON token request in the form:

```[json]
{
  "keyName": "I2ACJQ.Lv8AUQ",
  "ttl": 3600000,
  "timestamp": 1473894038255,
  "capability": "{\"*\":[\"*\"]}",
  "nonce": "f6799a8e7fa6f77b8e1dac55314789b1",
  "mac": "35nifY9SRZ8KRDfKOPIS1qYWGP16r2lD59zJo9TH8pA="
}
```

Now that we have a web server running and an authentication endpoint, we are ready to setup the Ably Realtime client that uses token auth.

First add the Ably client library loader from our CDN to the HTML file "@public/index.html@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/96b5a92dfb89887bff4d885bbb90c7925f091448/public/index.html

```[html]
  <head>
    <!-- other head content -->
    <script src="//cdn.ably.io/lib/ably.min-1.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  </head>
```

Then add the following to your "@public/app.js@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/96b5a92dfb89887bff4d885bbb90c7925f091448/public/app.js Javascript file:

```[javascript]
  var ably = new Ably.Realtime({ authUrl: '/auth' });
  ably.connection.on('connecting', function() { showStatus('Connecting to Ably...'); });
  ably.connection.on('connected', function() { clearStatus(); });
  ably.connection.on('disconnected', function() { showStatus('Disconnected from Ably...'); });
  ably.connection.on('suspended', function() { showStatus('Disconnected from Ably for a while...'); });

  var $status = $('#status');
  function showStatus(text) {
    $status.text(text).show();
  }
  function clearStatus() {
    $status.hide();
  }
```

The Ably Realtime client will now automatically obtain a token request from the provided @authUrl@ and then connect to Ably using that token request for authentication. At this point, run your server again with @node server.js@ and visiting "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ you should see the status element change to "Connecting to Ably..." whilst a connection is established, and the status become empty once the connection is established.

Now let's hook up the publishing of unsafe text to an Ably channel:

```[javascript]
  var publishChannel = ably.channels.get('neutrino:raw');
  var $actionButton = $('#action-btn');
  var $text = $('#text');

  $actionButton.on('click', () => {
    /* Publish unsafe text to the Ably channel so that the queue worker receives it via queues */
    publishChannel.publish('text', $text.val(), function(err) {
      if (err) {
        return showStatus('Failed to publish text!');
      }
    });
    $text.val(''); /* clear question for next */
  });
```

And add a subscriber that listens for new safe filtered text:

```[javascript]
  var filteredChannel = ably.channels.get('neutrino:filtered');
  var $output = $('#output');

  filteredChannel.subscribe(function(message) {
    var $filtered = $('<div class="filtered">').text(message.data.filtered);
    $output.prepend($('<div>').append($filtered));
  });
```

At this point the web app will instance an Ably Realtime library and connect to Ably, will publish messages to the @neutrino:raw@ channel when requested, and will automatically subscribe to filtered text from the @neutrino:filtered@ channel. However the queues and workers are not in place yet, so at this point publishing text won't do anything.

"See this complete step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/neutrino-node-step4

h2. Step 5 - Provision Reactor Queue and queue rules

Unlike pub/sub channels that are created on demand, Ably Reactor Message Queues must be provisioned in advance via the Ably app dashboards. Follow these steps to provision a new queue:

# "Log into your app dashboard":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030053-how-do-i-access-my-app-dashboard
# Under "Your apps", click on "Manage app" for any app you wish to use for this tutorial, or create a new one with the "Create New App" button
# Click on the "Queues" tab
# Click the "Provision a new Queue" button. When prompted, enter the name @neutrino@ for your queue and click "Create" to create your queue. See screenshot example below.

<a href="/images/tutorials/amqp/queue-amqp-neutrino-setup.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/amqp/queue-amqp-neutrino-setup.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Provision a Neutrino queue">
</a>

Once your queue is provisioned it is immediately ready to start receiving messages. However, without a queue rule, no messages will be routed to the queue. Let's set up a rule that ensures that text published by the web app Realtime client is republished to this new queue, and in turn the workers we will set up next can start consuming these messages. Follow these steps to set up a new queue rule:

# "Ensure you are still logged into your app dashboard":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030053-how-do-i-access-my-app-dashboard and navigate back to the app dashboard you used to provision your queue.
# Click on the "Reactor" tab
# Click the "New Reactor Rule" button, then choose "Reactor Queues". When prompted, choose the @neutrino@ queue you just provisioned, and enter @^neutrino:raw@ in the channel filter field to ensure that only unfiltered text published by clients is republished to the queue. The unfiltered text will then sit in the queue waiting for one or more workers (consumers) to process the text. See screenshot example below to set up a queue rule:

<a href="/images/tutorials/amqp/queue-amqp-neutrino-rule.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/amqp/queue-amqp-neutrino-rule.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Create a queue rule">
</a>

Before we move on, let's confirm that this rule is set up correctly. Try running your server again with @node server.js@ and visit "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/. Now type in some text in the text field and click the "Filter my bad language" button. The text should be published by the Realtime library to the channel @neutrino:raw@, which in turn the queue rule should ensure that the message is republished to the @neutrino@ queue you have just provisioned. Visit the "Queues" tab of your app dashboard again and check the "Message ready" count has increased. See screenshot below:

<a href="/images/tutorials/amqp/queue-amqp-neutrino-provisioned-test.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/amqp/queue-amqp-neutrino-provisioned-test.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Check that queue has updated">
</a>

h2. Step 6 - Add queue worker

We're now ready to start consuming messages from the queue. There are "plenty of STOMP compatible libraries":https://www.ably.io/download available, however for this tutorial we will us the popular @stompit@ library. First let's add the @stompit@ library to the "@package.json file@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/2f44b7153d3bf463e2cd5ac9ed702e303238d51c/package.json:

```[json]
  "dependencies": {
    "ably": "~1.0",
    "amqplib": "^0.4",
    "express": ">=4.14.0"
  }
```

Run @npm install@ to install the Node package dependencies.

Now create a "@worker.js@ file":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/2f44b7153d3bf463e2cd5ac9ed702e303238d51c/worker.js that will consume from the STOMP queue, process messages in real time and post a placeholder response back to the web client using REST:

```[nodejs]
  'use strict';

  const Stompit = require('stompit');
  const Ably = require('ably');

  /* Start the worker that consumes from the STOMP Queue */
  exports.start = function(apiKey, filteredChannelName, queueName, host, port, vhost) {
    const appId = apiKey.split('.')[0];
    const username = apiKey.split(':')[0];
    const password = apiKey.split(':')[1];
    const protocolVer = '1.1';
    const useTls = true;
    const queue = appId + ":" + queueName;
    const rest = new Ably.Rest({ key: apiKey });
    const filteredChannel = rest.channels.get(filteredChannelName);

    /* Connect to Ably STOMP queue */
    const connectOptions = {
      'host': host,
      'port': port,
      'ssl': true,
      'connectHeaders':{
        'host': vhost,
        'login': username,
        'passcode': password
      }
    };
    Stompit.connect(connectOptions, function(error, client) {
      if (error) {
        return console.error('worker:', 'STOMP client error!', error.message);
      }

      const subscribeHeaders = {
        /* To subscribe to an existing queue, /amq/queue prefix is required */
        'destination': '/amq/queue/' + queue,
        'ack': 'client-individual'
      };
      /* Wait for messages published to the Ably Reactor queue */
      client.subscribe(subscribeHeaders, function(error, message) {
        if (error) {
          return console.error('worker:', 'Subscribe error!', error.message);
        }

        message.readString('utf-8', function(error, body) {
          if (error) {
            return console.error('worker:', 'Read message error!', error.message);
          }

          const decodedEnvelope = JSON.parse(body);

          /* Use the Ably library to decode the message.
             The envelope messages attribute will only contain one message. However, in future versions,
             we may allow optional bundling of messages into a single queue message and as such this
             attribute is an Array to support that in future */
          const messages = Ably.Realtime.Message.fromEncodedArray(decodedEnvelope.messages);
          messages.forEach(function(message) {
            console.log('worker:', 'Received text', message.data, ' - about to ask Neutrino to filter bad words (WHEN IMPLEMENTED)');
          });

          client.ack(message);
        });
      });
    });
  };
```

Finally, we need to connect the worker to the web server we have created. In a production environment, your worker servers would almost certainly be run on different instances to your web servers. This decoupling is advisable to ensure that you can scale up your workers independently` of your web servers to meet demand. However, for simplicity of this demo, when the web server is started a worker server is also started concurrently.  Add the following to your "@server.js@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/2f44b7153d3bf463e2cd5ac9ed702e303238d51c/server.js

```[nodejs]
  const worker = require('./worker');
  /* Note the port is 61614 for STOMP over TLS */
  worker.start(ApiKey, 'neutrino:filtered', 'neutrino', 'us-east-1-a-queue.ably.io', 61614, 'shared');
```

Note that the:

* The queue host is extracted from the endpoint visible for each queue in the queue tab of your dashboard (see above)
* The port is always 61614 for STOMP over TLS
* The @vhost@ attribute is required and can be found in the queue tab for each queue
* The queue name argument @neutrino@ passed to @worker.start@ is in fact appended to the @appId@ in the @start@ function. All fully qualified queue names follow the format @appId:queueName@ as you will see in your queue tab
* Whilst the code above can handle multiple messages per envelope, we currently only support one message per envelope. The envelope @messages@ attribute is an @Array@ so that in future we could optionally support message bundling

"See this complete step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/neutrino-node-step6

h2. Step 7 - Connect the worker to Neutrino

Everything is now in place to consume raw unfiltered text using a worker and publish the filtered text back to the client, however we need to plug in the "Neutrino Bad Word Filter API":https://www.neutrinoapi.com/api/bad-word-filter/.

Firstly you need to obtain a Neutrino Api Key. Visit the "Neutrino API signup page":https://www.neutrinoapi.com/signup/, enter your details and and click the "Create Account" button:

<a href="/images/tutorials/amqp/neutrino-signup.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/amqp/neutrino-signup.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Neutrino sign up">
</a>

Once you have created an account, visit your dashboard and click on "API Keys":

<a href="/images/tutorials/neutrino-dashboard.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/neutrino-dashboard.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Neutrino dashboard">
</a>

Finally, copy one of the API keys to your clipboard:

<a href="/images/tutorials/amqp/neutrino-api-keys.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/amqp/neutrino-api-keys.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Neutrino API keys">
</a>

Now that you have an API key you can use to communicate with the Neutrino API, you'll need an HTTP library for the worker. @request@ provides a straightforward API for HTTP requests, so add it to "@package.json file@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/9818ec8bb7eaf97016a8bdae472236cb51335e48/package.json:

```[json]
  "dependencies": {
    "ably": "~1.0",
    "express": ">=4.14.0",
    "request": ">=2.79.0",
    "stompit": "^0.24"
  }
```

Run @npm install@ to install the Node package dependencies.

Now add the following to "@worker.js@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/9818ec8bb7eaf97016a8bdae472236cb51335e48/worker.js so that consumed text is sent to the Neutrino Bad Word Filter API, and filtered text from the API is published back to the web client through an Ably pub/sub channel:

```[nodejs]
  const NeutrinoUserId = 'INSERT-YOUR-NEUTRINO-USER-ID-HERE';
  const NeutrinoApiKey = 'INSERT-YOUR-NEUTRINO-API-KEY-HERE';
  const request = require('request');
  const querystring = require("querystring");

  /* Send text over HTTP to Neutrino to filter the profanities */
  function filterTextAndPublish(ablyChannel, text) {
    var url = NeutrinoEndpoint + '?' + querystring.stringify({
      "user-id": NeutrinoUserId,
      "api-key": NeutrinoApiKey,
      "content": text,
      "censor-character": "*"
    });
    request(url, function (error, response, body) {
      if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
        publishFilteredText(ablyChannel, text, JSON.parse(body)["censored-content"]);
      } else {
        if (body) {
          publishFilteredText(ablyChannel, text, "Neutrino couldn't compute: " + body);
        } else {
          publishFilteredText(ablyChannel, text, "Neutrino error: " + JSON.stringify(error));
        }
      }
    });
  }

  function publishFilteredText(ablyChannel, rawText, filteredText) {
    ablyChannel.publish('text', { filteredText: filteredText }, function(err) {
      if (err) {
        console.error('worker:', 'Failed to publish text', JSON.stringify(err));
      }
    });
  }
```

And replace the existing @messages.forEach@ block in the @start@ function with the following:

```[nodejs]
  messages.forEach(function(message) {
    filterTextAndPublish(filteredChannel, neutrinoUserId, neutrinoApiKey, message.data);
  });
```

That's it, you are now issuing HTTP requests to Neutrino whenever a message is consumed from the message queue, and publishing the responses back to the web client using the REST library.

Try running your server again with @node server.js@ and visit "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/. Now type in some text in the text field and click the "Filter my bad language" button. You should see a response from Neutrino appear within the time it takes for Neutrino to filter the profanities from your text.
