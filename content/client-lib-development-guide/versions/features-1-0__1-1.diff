 * @(G2)@ All tests by default are run against a special Ably sandbox environment.  This environment allows apps to be provisioned without any authentication that can then be used for client library testing. Bear in mind that all apps created in the sandbox environment are automatically deleted after 60 minutes and have low limits to prevent abuse. Apps are configured by sending a @POST@ request to @https://sandbox-rest.ably.io/apps@ with a JSON body that specifies the keys and their associated capabilities, channel namespace rules and any presence fixture data that is required; see "ably-common test-app-setup.json":https://github.com/ably/ably-common/blob/master/test-resources/test-app-setup.json. Presence fixture data is necessary for the REST library presence tests as there is no way to register presence on a channel in the REST library
 * @(G3)@ Testing statistics can be tricky due to timing issues and slow test suites as a result of sending requests to generate statistics.  As such, we provide a special stats endpoint in our sandbox environment that allows stats to be injected into our metrics system so that stats tests can make predictable assertions.  To create stats you must send an authenticated @POST@ request to the stats JSON to @https://sandbox-rest.ably.io/stats@ with the stats data you wish to create.

The @info@ log level is preferred as customers can hide this entry by configuring the client library log level to @warning@, yet will, by default, see this notice when using a client library with exception reporting enabled
+*** @(RSC20b2)@ Any unhandled internal exceptions should automatically submit bug reports to the @logExceptionReportingUrl@ using the "@Sentry API@":https://docs.sentry.io/clientdev/ either via a raw HTTP request or by using an embedded "Sentry exception reporting client library":https://docs.sentry.io/clients/. A message at @info@ log level should be logged if the request succeeds or fails i.e. a failure to submit an exception should not be logged as a failure / error. Where possible, the exception GUID returned from the Sentry API should be logged so that the specific error can be tracked
+** @(RSC20c)@ Exceptions reported must additionally include the following tags: @ably-lib@ with the value defined in "@RSC7b@":RSC7b, @ably-version@ with the value defined in "@RSC7a@":RSC7a, @appId@ if known from either the token or API key currently being used.
+** @(RSC20d)@ All personally identifiable information, as much as is practicable, must be redacted or stripped completely before being submitted to Ably. Our intent is only to capture necessary information to debug issues in our own code
+** @(RSC20e)@ Failures to log exceptions to the @errors.ably.io@ endpoint must be handled gracefully. This includes for example DNS failures, TCP/HTTP requests rejected, slow requests and internal failure errors. Additionally, as specified in @RSC20b2@, a failure to log an exception is logged with log level @info@ i.e. an exception reporting failure is not consider a client library @error@ or @warning@
+** @(RSC20f)@ Any errors emitted by the library as a result of an internal failure must contain a status code @500@, an error code in the range @51000@ to @51999@ and a suitable error message.
