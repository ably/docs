 Ably's presence feature allows clients or devices to announce their presence on a channel. Other devices or services may then subscribe to these presence events (such as entering, updating their state, or leaving the channel) in real time using our "realtime SDKs":/realtime, or via the "Reactor service":https://www.ably.io/reactor. You can also request a list of clients or devices that are online/offline on a channel at a particular point in time via the "REST API":/rest-api#presence.

 Furthermore, if persistence is enabled on the presence channel, you can also retrieve "presence history":/rest/history#presence-history for the channel, i.e, static data about historical presence states of your clients/devices. This operation also can be done using both Ably's "Realtime":/realtime and "REST":/rest libraries.
