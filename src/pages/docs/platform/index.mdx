title: About Ably
meta_description: "An introduction to Ably and its highly-available, scalable platform."
---

Ably is a highly-scalable serverless WebSocket platform used to power realtime digital experiences.

At its core, Ably is a cloud-based Pub/Sub (publish/subscribe) platform-as-a-service (PaaS). It ensures that any messages published to Ably by any device will be received, in realtime, by any number of subscribing devices.

## Platform <a id="platform"/>

Ably's platform enables data to be streamed between all internet-connected devices, such as browsers, servers and mobile phones. It offers enterprise-scale messaging, that automatically scales to meet demand, a highly-available service, message delivery guarantees, and low latency across the globe.

Ably is engineered around the following four key principles to ensure the dependability of its service:

* [Performance](https://ably.com/four-pillars-of-dependability#performance): high performance ensures that the end-to-end latency and bandwidth for data sent via the platform is minimized, and maintained at scale.
* [Integrity](https://ably.com/four-pillars-of-dependability#integrity): Ably provides guarantees for the realtime messages sent using the Ably platform so that you don't need to handle missed, duplicated or unordered messages yourself.
* [Reliability](https://ably.com/four-pillars-of-dependability#reliability): a fault-tolerant platform is reliable by ensuring that there is sufficient redundancy at a regional and global level to provide continuity of service in the face of infrastructure failures.
* [Availability](https://ably.com/four-pillars-of-dependability#availability): the Ably platform is designed to be elastic and highly-available so that you can use it at any time, even under high load.

## Infrastructure <a id="infrastructure"/>

The Ably platform has fault-tolerant, highly-available, elastic global infrastructure for effortless scaling.

It is built primarily on Amazon's cloud infrastructure. Ably has servers distributed across more than 15 physical datacenters within the AWS network, with 700+ edge locations globally through AWS CloudFront, so that there isn't a single point of failure, nor single point of congestion across the service. Ably is designed to route messages using the least amount of network hops to minimize latency and maximize performance for clients, regardless of their location.

Clients are automatically connected to the nearest datacenter to reduce latency, and each datacenter is physically isolated from the others, ensuring that a failure in one datacenter has no effect on any other datacenter.

Each datacenter scales independently to meet the load within that region. Load is dynamically assigned and reassigned across servers in realtime, and the service auto-heals and routes around network failures.

## Global network information <a id="network-info"/>

* View the [network map](https://ably.com/network) of Ably's datacenters and global points of presence.
* Check the [status of datacenters](https://status.ably.io/) by region.
* See [global round-trip latency statistics](https://ably.com/docs/platform/architecture/latency#latency-metrics) measured externally by Uptrends.

## Security <a id="security"/>

Ably takes security seriously and has implemented comprehensive measures to protect the platform and user data. For detailed information about security measures, see the [edge network security documentation](/docs/platform/architecture/edge-network#protection-against-denial-of-service-attacks) and [encryption options](/docs/channels/options/encryption).

## Integrations <a id="integrations"/>

Ably [integrations](/docs/platform/integrations) enable you to send your data from Ably to an external service or push data into Ably from an external service. You can trigger actions in your integrated services when events occur in Ably or send data to Ably from external systems.

Some of the integrations available with Ably include:

* HTTP callbacks for triggering external events.
* IFTTT and Zapier for workflow automation.
* Amazon Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and Cloudflare Workers for serverless function execution.
* Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon SQS, AMQP, and Pulsar for continuous data streaming.

## Products and SDKs <a id="products"/>

Use Ably's products and SDKs to build realtime applications for your clients. They all utilize Ably's reliable platform to ensure that you don't need to worry about managing things such as scaling, latency and data integrity.


### Ably Pub/Sub <a id="pub-sub"/>

Ably's core [Pub/Sub](/docs/basics) product provides flexible APIs that are feature-rich and powerful. These flexible APIs are the building blocks for crafting any type of realtime experience for your customers.

Ably's other products are built on top of Pub/Sub. They utilize the same platform with the some guarantees and benefits. These products can be considered abstractions, with APIs designed to simplify and build applications more quickly for the most popular use cases.

### Ably Chat <a id="chat"/>
