      Ably Chat is a product dedicated to making it quick and easy to build chat functionality into new and existing applications. Use Ably Chat to build things such as a 1:1 customer support feature, or add a chat component to a livestreaming platform that serves hundreds of thousands of users.

      The Chat SDK contains a set of purpose-built APIs that abstract away the complexities involved in how you would architect chat features. The SDK is built on top of Ably's distributed platform, which means that the same [performance guarantees](https://ably.com/four-pillars-of-dependability) apply to Chat.

      If you have any feedback or feature requests, [let us know](https://forms.gle/SmCLNFoRrYmkbZSf8). All feedback will help prioritize improvements and enhancements in subsequent releases.
