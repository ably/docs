Extract chat messages from Ably Chat to external systems for storage, processing, or analysis. This enables you to build features like AI assistants, long-term storage, compliance systems, and more while maintaining realtime message delivery to chat participants.

Chat rooms are built on Ably Pub/Sub channels, allowing you to leverage the full range of Ably's [platform integrations](/docs/platform/integrations) to forward messages to external systems.

## Common use cases <a id="use-cases"/>

### Process messages with external systems <a id="process-messages"/>

Extract and process messages through external systems, then respond back to the chat in real-time:

* **AI-powered assistance**: Process commands through language models and respond with helpful information
* **Real-time translation**: Automatically translate messages for multilingual chat rooms
* **Content moderation**: Filter messages through moderation services
* **Notifications**: Detect mentions or keywords and trigger custom notification systems
* **Command processing**: Handle slash commands that invoke server-side logic

### Store messages in your database <a id="store-messages"/>

Export chat messages to your own database for long-term storage and additional capabilities:

* **Compliance and legal requirements**: Meet data retention policies and regulatory requirements
* **Analytics and business intelligence**: Build dashboards, train ML models, analyze sentiment
* **Enhanced functionality**: Implement features that need chat history, such as full-text search
* **Single source of truth**: Maintain your database as the canonical source
* **Long-term storage**: Store data for longer than Ably Chat's maximum retention period (365 days)

## How it works <a id="how-it-works"/>

When using Ably's [platform integrations](/docs/platform/integrations) to extract messages from chat rooms:

1. Configure an integration rule to match specific chat rooms using channel name filters
2. Ably forwards matching messages to your external system via webhook, queue, or streaming
3. Your system decodes and processes the messages
4. Optionally respond back to the chat (for processing use cases)

## Integration methods <a id="methods"/>

Choose the integration method that fits your architecture and scale requirements:

| Method | Best For | Delivery Guarantee |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| [Webhooks](/docs/platform/integrations/webhooks) | Serverless functions, simple endpoints | At-least-once with limited retry |
| [Ably Queues](/docs/platform/integrations/queues) | Ordered processing, fault-tolerant delivery | At-least-once with dead letter queue |
| [Streaming](/docs/platform/integrations/streaming) | High-throughput, existing infrastructure | Depends on target system |

[Read the extraction guide →](/docs/chat/external-storage-and-processing/data-extraction) to learn how to set up integrations for use with chat rooms.
