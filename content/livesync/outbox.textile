Use these instructions to configure, install and use the Ably Database Connector(ADBC) and outbox table.

h2(#authenticate). Authenticate

An "API key":/auth#api-keys is required to authenticate with Ably. API keys are used either to authenticate directly with Ably using "basic authentication":/auth/basic, or to generate tokens for untrusted clients using "token authentication":/auth/token.

<aside data-type='important'>
<p>The examples use "basic authentication":/auth/basic to demonstrate features for convenience. In your own applications, basic authentication should never be used on the client-side as it exposes your Ably API key. Instead use "token authentication":/auth/token. </p>
</aside>

"Sign up":https://ably.com/sign-up to Ably to create an API key in the "dashboard":https://ably.com/dashboard or use the "Control API":/account/control-api to create an API programmatically.

API keys and tokens have a set of capabilities assigned to them that specify which operations, such as @subscribe@ or @publish@ can be performed on which resources. To use the Spaces SDK, the API key requires the following "capabilities":/auth/capabilities#58: 

* Publish
* Subscribe
* Presence
* History
