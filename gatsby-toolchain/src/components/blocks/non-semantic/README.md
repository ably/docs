# Non-Semantic Blocks

Non-semantic blocks represent HTML that does not affect the meaning of surrounding or embedded text in any way.

Technically `<div>` and `<span>` blocks are also considered non-semantic HTML, however for developers &amp; especially for purposes of targeting particular sections of HTML these can prove to be very meaningful in practice, so they are not included here.

Examples:
`<hr />`, `<br />`, `<wbr />`
