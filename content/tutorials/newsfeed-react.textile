In this tutorial, we will see how to use the "Ably Realtime client library":/realtime to build a realtime news feed with React. Ably enables realtime data sharing using Pub/Sub messaging architecture via a concept called "channels":/core-features/channels.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll not discuss storage of messages or other server-side mechanisms.

"React":https://reactjs.org is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is component-based and declarative which makes it easy to build complex UI with it.

<%= partial partial_version('tutorials/_step-1-create-app-and-api-key') %>

h2(#create-react-app). Step 2 - Create a React App

Prerequisites:

* Make sure "Node and NPM are installed":https://nodejs.org/en/download/ on your system.
* You do not need to install React separately as we'll be using NPX (that comes bundled with NPM) for doing this.

We'll start by creating a new React app. To do this, we'll be using the "@create-react-app@":https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app command that allows you to create a React app without having to worry about build configurations.

We'll call the app @newsfeed-app@. Let's create the app from the terminal by running:

```[sh]
npx create-react-app newsfeed-app
```

The new React app is ready, we can run it locally as follows:

```[sh]
cd newsfeed-app && npm start
```

This builds the static site, runs a web server and opens a browser. If your browser does not open automatically, navigate to "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000 to open it up manually.

We will be using Semantic UI which is a UI component framework, to build UI easily and quickly. Let's install that package as well as one for @ably@, by running the following command from the terminal:

```[sh]
npm install --save ably semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/1e45b4330838f1ce92a3bcadfd4918d3cb5ecb23

h2(#update-css). Step 3 - Update CSS

The @semantic-ui-css@ contains the CSS for the Semantic UI framework. We'll need to add an import statement to @index.js@ file to enable use of @semantic-ui-css@:

```[javascript]
import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css'
```

We need to add some CSS to style the HTML elements. You can simply replace the auto-filled contents in your @App.css@ with the following:

```[stylesheet]
.App-header {
  margin-top: 10px;
}

.App-button {
  margin-top: 5px;
  float: right;
}

.App-users {
  margin-top: 10px;
  text-align: left;
}

.App-update {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  text-align: center;
}

.App-cards {
  overflow-y: scroll;
  max-height: 500px;
}
```

h2(#add-pub-sub). Step 4 -  Add Publish/Subscribe mechanism using Ably

We'll get started with a few import statements, add the following to your @App.js@ file:

```[javascript]
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import * as Ably from 'ably';
import './App.css';
```

In our newsfeed app, we would like to display the profile information of each user who is publishing a new update. Since we are not including any database and such for this tutorial, we'll simply assign a random avatar and random name to each user who is using an instance of the application.

So, let's add two arrays, one each for avatars(hosted image URLs) and names to be assigned randomly to the users who log in. We'll also add a random function to pick an item from these arrays. Feel free to replace them with any other images and names that you like:

```[javascript]
// User avatars
const avatarsInAssets = [
 "https://cdn.glitch.com/0bff6817-d500-425d-953c-6424d752d171%2Favatar_8.png?1536042504672",
 "https://cdn.glitch.com/0bff6817-d500-425d-953c-6424d752d171%2Favatar_3.png?1536042507202",
 "https://cdn.glitch.com/0bff6817-d500-425d-953c-6424d752d171%2Favatar_6.png?1536042508902",
 "https://cdn.glitch.com/0bff6817-d500-425d-953c-6424d752d171%2Favatar_10.png?1536042509036",
 "https://cdn.glitch.com/0bff6817-d500-425d-953c-6424d752d171%2Favatar_7.png?1536042509659",
 "https://cdn.glitch.com/0bff6817-d500-425d-953c-6424d752d171%2Favatar_9.png?1536042513205",
 "https://cdn.glitch.com/0bff6817-d500-425d-953c-6424d752d171%2Favatar_2.png?1536042514285",
 "https://cdn.glitch.com/0bff6817-d500-425d-953c-6424d752d171%2Favatar_1.png?1536042516362",
 "https://cdn.glitch.com/0bff6817-d500-425d-953c-6424d752d171%2Favatar_4.png?1536042516573",
 "https://cdn.glitch.com/0bff6817-d500-425d-953c-6424d752d171%2Favatar_5.png?1536042517889"
];

// User names
const names = [
  "Ross",
  "Monica",
  "Rachel",
  "Joey",
  "Chandler",
  "Steve",
  "Bill",
  "Elon",
  "Tom",
  "Shaun"
];

// Get random
function getRandomArbitrary(min, max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min) + min);
}
```

Now, let's instantiate the Ably realtime library as well as the channels that we'll use to share realtime data. Remember to replace '<YOUR-API-KEY>' with your own API key value. We'll also assign a name and avatar to the current user:

```[javascript]
    const myId = "id-" + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 16);
    const apiKey = '<YOUR-API-KEY>';
    // Ably Instance
    const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
        key: apiKey,
        clientId: myId,
        echoMessages: false
    });
    const chatChannel = ably.channels.get("chat");
    const presenceChannel = ably.channels.get("presence");
    let my = {};
    my.avatar = avatarsInAssets[getRandomArbitrary(0, 9)];
    my.name = names[getRandomArbitrary(0, 9)]
```

We have passed a few "client options":https://ably.com/docs/api/realtime-sdk#client-options when instantiating Ably:
* @key@ is the API key
* @clientId@ is used to uniquely identify a client within an Ably app
* @echoMessages@ if false, prevents messages originating from this connection being echoed back on the same connection

"Channels":https://ably.com/docs/realtime/channels#title are the medium through which messages are distributed; clients attach to channels to subscribe to messages, and every message published to that channel is broadcast by Ably to all its subscribers.

"Presence":https://ably.com/docs/realtime/presence#title enables clients to be aware of other clients that are currently “present” on a channel, i.e, connected or online.

Now, let’s make the functional @App@ component and states within it to hold the user input as well as the updates coming in:

```[javascript]
const App = () => {
  const [todoInput, setTodoInput] = useState(""); // User Input/Message
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    msgs: [],
    newMsgs: []
  }); // to hold all messages and incoming new messages

  let you = {};
}
```

Subscribing to a channel would let the client automatically receive all updates published on that channel by other clients, in realtime. So, let’s subscribe to the channels in the @useEffect hook@ on mount of the @App@ component:

```[javascript]
useEffect(() => {
        // Subscribing for userInfo details to assign name and avatar
        chatChannel.subscribe("userInfo", (data) => {
            var dataObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data));
            if (dataObj.clientId !== myId) {
                you.avatar = dataObj.data.avatar;
                you.name = dataObj.data.name;
            }
        });

        // When a new member joins publish it's userInfo details
        presenceChannel.presence.subscribe('enter', function (member) {
            if (member.clientId !== myId) {
                chatChannel.publish("userInfo", {
                    "avatar": my.avatar,
                    "name": my.name
                });
            }
        });

        presenceChannel.presence.enter();

        // Get all members and publish userInfo details
        presenceChannel.presence.get(function (err, members) {
            for (var i in members) {
                if (members[i].clientId !== myId) {
                    chatChannel.publish("userInfo", {
                        "avatar": my.avatar,
                        "name": my.name
                    });
                }
            }
        });

        // Subscribing for chatMessage
        chatChannel.subscribe("chatMessage", (data) => {
            var dataObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data));
            var message = dataObj.data.message;
            var date = new Date(dataObj.data.date);

            // Updating the state newMsgs with new incoming message
            setState(prevState => {
              return {
                ...prevState,
                newMsgs: [
                  ...prevState.newMsgs,
                  { summary: message, image: you.avatar, date: date, name: you.name }
                ]
              };
            });
        })

      }, []);
```

As you can see we subscribe to many channels and the publish our data. Let's discuss each of them in more detail:

* We are using the @presenceChannel@ to share the connection info or online presence of a user. A user can set themselves as connected by entering the presence channel. We do this by calling the @enter@ method on that channel.
* Next, we use another channel, i.e. the @chatChannel@ to publish the user info.
* We also need to subscribe to the same @chatChannel@ to receive the @userInfo@ from other users. In most cases, you would subscribe to a channel before publishing to it if you are intending to receive back your own messages as well.
* Lastly, in the same @chatChannel@ we subscribe to the @chatMessage@ event to get the updates to be displayed in the news feed. We then update the state variables with this new update.

Now, add the following imports statements on top of the file @App.js@ after the @Ably@ import statement to enable use of @Semantic-UI@:

```[javascript]
import {
  Container,
  Header,
  Divider,
  Button,
  Form,
  TextArea
} from "semantic-ui-react";
```

Next, let's add the @sendMyMessage@ function to the @App@ component and the corresponding HTML to post an update:

```[javascript]
function sendMyMessage() {
        const newMsgId = "msg-id-" + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 6);
        setTodoInput("");
        if (todoInput !== "") {
            // Publishing the message
            chatChannel.publish("chatMessage", {
                message: todoInput,
                localMsgId: newMsgId,
                date: new Date()
            });

            // Updating the state msgs with the message of the current user and sorting
            setState(prevState => {
              return {
                ...prevState,
                msgs: [
                  ...prevState.msgs,
                  {
                    summary: todoInput,
                    image: my.avatar,
                    date: new Date(),
                    name: my.name
                  }
                ].sort((a, b) => b.date - a.date)
              };
           });
        }
    }

    return (
        <Container textAlign='left' className='App-header'>
          <Header as='h2'>Ably React Tutorial - RealTime</Header>
          <Form>
             <TextArea
                value={todoInput}
                placeholder="Post an update"
                onChange={e => setTodoInput(e.target.value)}
             />
             <div className="App-button">
               <Button content="Send" primary onClick={sendMyMessage} />
             </div>
         </Form>

         <Divider />

         </Container>
    )
```

As you can see in the @sendMyMessage@ function, we publish the @chatMessage@ event on the @chatChannel@ channel and update the local state accordingly with the new update posted by the user.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/e5f66d1dc0aa1d488e0e0aff8d8cff0042007c42

h2(#display-updates). Step 5 - Displaying the updates in the news feed

Now that we have the data to be displayed in the news feed, let us display this in the UI. We'll start by adding the following imports statements in @App.js@ file:

```[javascript]
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import {
  Container,
  Header,
  Divider,
  Button,
  Form,
  TextArea,
  Label
} from "semantic-ui-react";
import UICard from "./UICard";
```

Next, let's add a mechanism to reset the scroll to the top of the newsfeed. Add the following on the top of the @App@ component above the @todoInput@ state:

```[javascript]
const scrollRef = useRef(null); // for getting scroll ref
const [todoInput, setTodoInput] = useState(""); // User Input/Message
```

Next, add the function @getMessages()@ below the @sendMyMessage()@ function we previously added, to update the news feed with the new updates:

```[javascript]
function getMessages() {
    // Updating the state with latest messages and sorting
    setState(prevState => {
      return {
        ...prevState,
        msgs: [...prevState.msgs, ...prevState.newMsgs].sort(
          (a, b) => b.date - a.date
        ),
        newMsgs: []
      };
    });

    // Scrolling to top for viewing new messages
    scrollRef.current.scrollTop = 0;
}
```

We'll display each update in its own card style structure. So, let's create a new file called @UICard.js@ in the src folder and add the following code:

```[javascript]
import React from 'react'
import { Card, Image, Segment } from 'semantic-ui-react'

// Formatting date
function formatAMPM(date) {
  var hours = date.getHours();
  var minutes = date.getMinutes();
  var ampm = hours >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM';
  hours %= 12;
  hours = hours ? hours : 12;
  minutes = minutes < 10 ? '0' + minutes : minutes;
  var strTime = hours + ':' + minutes + ' ' + ampm;
  return strTime;
}

const UICard = (props) => {
  return (
    <Segment>
{props.events.map((event, index) => {
  return (
    <Card fluid key={index} index={index}>
      <Card.Content>
        <Image
          floated='right'
          size='mini'
          src={event.image}
        />
        <Card.Header>{event.name}</Card.Header>
        <Card.Meta>{formatAMPM(event.date)}</Card.Meta>
        <Card.Description>
          {event.summary}
        </Card.Description>
      </Card.Content>
    </Card>
     )
    })}
  </Segment>
)
  }

export default UICard
```

The @formatAMPM@ function is used to display the date in readable format. Using the props the @UICard@ component displays the news feed.

Now, let’s update the @return@ method of the @App@ component to use @UICard@ component to display the news feed:

```[javascript]
return (
    <Container textAlign="left" className="App-header">
      <Header as="h2">Ably React Tutorial - RealTime</Header>
      <Form>
        <TextArea
          value={todoInput}
          placeholder="Post an update"
          onChange={e => setTodoInput(e.target.value)}
        />
        <div className="App-button">
          <Button content="Send" primary onClick={sendMyMessage} />
        </div>
      </Form>

      <Divider />
      <div onClick={getMessages} className="App-update">
        {state.newMsgs.length !== 0 && (
          <Label>
            {state.newMsgs.length.toString()} new update
            {state.newMsgs.length === 1 ? "" : "s"} have arrived!
          </Label>
        )}
      </div>
      {state.msgs.length !== 0 && (
        <div ref={scrollRef} className="App-cards">
          <UICard events={state.msgs} />
        </div>
      )}
    </Container>
  );
```

h2(#retrieve-online-users). Step 6 - Retrieving online users using Ably's Channel Occupancy API

Ably's offers some special channels called Metachannels to share information about the channels themselves in a given app. These channels always start with the @[meta]@ qualifier, separating them from the regular channels used for realtime data transfer.

Among other things, the metadata that is of interest to us is the channel occupancy event updates which are published on the metachannel identified by @[meta]channel.lifecycle@. We will use the channel occupancy here to get active connections. Please note that channel occupancy event updates are an enterprise only feature. You can still use the "Channel Status API":/rest/channel-status to poll Ably for meta info about the channels in an app.

Let's add a subscription to this metachannel. Add it below the @presenceChannel@ variable:

```[javascript]
const presenceChannel = ably.channels.get("presence");
const metaChannel = ably.channels.get("[meta]channel.lifecycle");
```

Now, add a state variable to hold the online users' count, in the @App@ component:

```[javascript]
const [onlineUsers, setOnlineUsers] = useState(0); // for online users
```

Now let's add the subscribe method on the @metaChannel@ channel in the @useEffect hook@:

```[javascript]
// Using Channel Occupancy to get online users
metaChannel.subscribe("channel.occupancy", msg => {
      var msgJSONobj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(msg.data));
      if (msgJSONobj.name === "chat") {
        // Update the state OnlineUsers
        setOnlineUsers(msgJSONobj.status.occupancy.metrics.connections);
      }
});
```

So using the Channel Occupancy API response we set the @onlineUsers@ variable to hold the number of online users.

Now, update the @return@ method of the @App@ component to show the online users count:

```[javascript]
</Form>
      <div className="App-users">
        {onlineUsers !== 0 && (
          <Label>
            User{onlineUsers === 1 ? "" : "s"} Online - {onlineUsers.toString()}
          </Label>
        )}
      </div>
<Divider />
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/55d2b927547b6b7520fe4bde2dec0fa0948ae152

That’s it! We now have a news feed that updates in realtime. To test it out, you can run the app locally from the terminal:

```[sh]
npm start
```

Then open "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000 in two different browser tabs. Post an update in one of the opened tabs and watch the other tab update in realtime.
