The modern internet is a web of different languages, platforms, open and proprietary protocols, and services built on top of other services. This isnâ€™t likely to change anytime soon so a platform that supports widespread interoperability is essential in the long-term. There are three questions to help assess how interoperable a platform is:

* How extensively does the platform "support":https://ably.io/download?utm_source={{COMPANY_ID_0}}_v_{{COMPANY_ID_1}}&utm_medium=compare_pages different languages, frameworks, and protocols?
* How easy is it to migrate to or move away from the platform?
* Are there "adapters":https://www.ably.io/adapters?utm_source={{COMPANY_ID_0}}_v_{{COMPANY_ID_1}}&utm_medium=compare_pages for streaming data into third party platforms?
