The Ably Realtime client libraries establish and maintain a persistent connection to Ably enabling extremely low latency broadcasting of messages and presence state.  All official client library APIs are consistent across every language, offer pub/sub and presence on channels, handle both basic and token authentication, manage changing network conditions, include optional symmetrical encryption and provide access to channel, presence and metrics history.
