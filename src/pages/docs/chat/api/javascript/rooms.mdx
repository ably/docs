---

The `Rooms` interface manages the lifecycle of chat rooms.

Access it via `ChatClient.rooms`.

---

## Create a room <a id="get"/>

`ChatClient.rooms.get()`

Create or retrieve `Room` object. Optionally provide custom configuration to the room.

Call [`release()`](#release) when the `Room` object is no longer needed. If a call to `get()` is made for a room that is currently being released, then the promise will only resolve when the release operation is complete.

If a call to `get()` is made, followed by a subsequent call to `release()` before the promise resolves, then the promise will reject with an error.

`get(name: string, options?: RoomOptions): Promise<Room>`

### Parameters

Use the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Type |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `name` | The name of the room to create or retrieve. | String |
| `options` | *Optional* Custom configuration options for the room. | [`RoomOptions`](#roomoptions) |

#### RoomOptions

The following `RoomOptions` can be set:

| Properties | Description | Type |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `messages` | *Optional* The configuration for messages in the room. | [`MessageOptions`](#messageoptions) |
| `occupancy` | *Optional* The configuration for occupancy in the room. | [`OccupancyOptions`](#occupancyoptions) |
| `presence` | *Optional* The configuration for presence in the room. | [`PresenceOptions`](#presenceoptions) |
| `typing` | *Optional* The configuration for typing indicators in the room. | [`TypingOptions`](#typingoptions) |

#### MessageOptions

The following `MessageOptions` can be set:

| Properties | Description | Type |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `defaultMessageReactionType` | *Optional* The default type of message reaction. Other types can still be sent by specifying the `type` parameter when reacting to a message. The default value is `distinct`. | [`MessageReactionType`](#messagereactiontype) |
| `rawMessageReactions` | *Optional* Whether subscribers should receive individual message reactions, rather than just aggregates. The default value is `false`. | Boolean |

#### MessageReactionType

An enum that represents the types of reactions for a message.

It has the following members:

| Member | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `Distinct` | Allows for at most one reaction of each type per client per message. It is possible for a client to add multiple reactions to the same message as long as they are different (e.g. different emojis). Duplicates are not counted in the summary. This is similar to reactions on Slack. |
| `Multiple` | Allows any number of reactions, including repeats, and they are counted in the summary. The reaction payload also includes a count of how many times each reaction should be counted (defaults to 1 if not set). This is similar to the clap feature on Medium. |
| `Unique` | Allows for at most one reaction per client per message. If a client reacts to a message a second time, only the second reaction is counted in the summary. This is similar to reactions on iMessage, Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. |

#### OccupancyOptions

The following `OccupancyOptions` can be set:

| Properties | Description | Type |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `enableEvents` | *Optional* Sets whether the client should receive [occupancy](docs/chat/api/javascript/occupancy) events. If enabled, the client will receive messages detailing the changing room occupancy. The default value is `false`. | Boolean |

#### PresenceOptions

The following `PresenceOptions` can be set:

| Properties | Description | Type |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `enableEvents` | *Optional* Sets whether the client should receive [presence](docs/chat/api/javascript/presence) events. If enabled, the client will presence updates about other clients in the room. Note that even if the client hasn't subscribed to presence, they are still streamed presence events by the server. Clients can also still register their presence in the room without receiving presence events. The default value is `true`. | Boolean |

#### TypingOptions

The following `TypingOptions` can be set:

| Properties | Description | Type |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `heartbeatThrottleMs` | *Optional* Set the minimum time interval between consecutive `typing.started` events. The interval is reset after a `typing.stopped` event. The default value is `10000`. | Number |

### Returns

Returns a promise. On success, the promise is fulfilled with the new or existing room object. On failure, the promise is rejected with an [`ErrorInfo`](/docs/chat/api/javascript/error-info) if a room with the same name but different `options` already exists.

<Code>
```javascript
const room = await chatClient.rooms.get('livestream-1', {occupancy: {enableEvents: true}});
```
</Code>

---

## Release a room <a id="release"/>

`ChatClient.rooms.release()`

Releases a `Room` object, allowing for it to be garbage collected.

This will release the reference to the `Room` object from the `Rooms` collection and detach it from Ably. It does not unsubscribe the client from any events. Call [`Rooms.get()`](#get) if you want to get the `Room` object back.

`release(name: string): Promise<void>`

### Parameters

Use the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Type |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `name` | The name of the room to release. | String |

### Returns

Returns a promise. On success, the promise is fulfilled. On failure, the promise is rejected with an [`ErrorInfo`](/docs/chat/api/javascript/error-info).

<Code>
```javascript
await rooms.release('livestream-1');
```
</Code>
