Ably Documentation Overview
===========================

[Ably](https://ably.io) is a hugely scalable, superfast and secure hosted realtime messaging service for web-enabled devices.

This Git repository contains most of the [Ably API documentation](https://ably.io/documentation) that resides at <https://ably.io/documentation> in [Textile](redcloth.org/textile) format.  [Nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) is used to build the static site from the `source` branch.

The Ably documentation was intentionally created as a public repository using a simple text based markup language so that:

* It can be maintained by Ably staff and developers.
* 3rd parties can fork the repository, and submit pull requests to improve the documentation.  We welcome the community's suggestions and input.
* This documentation is later merged upstream to the [Ably primary website documentation](https://ably.io/documentation) with each website releas.

Viewing the documentation
------

The static site generated from this documentation repository is hosted at <http://docs.ably.io>.  We frequently publish updates from this repository so is typically more up to date than the [official Ably API documentation](https://ably.io/documentation).

The official complete Ably documentation that incoporates all the documentation in this repository can be found at <https://ably.io/documentation>
