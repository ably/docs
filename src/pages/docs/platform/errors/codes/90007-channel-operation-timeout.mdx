# Error 90007: Channel operation timeout

## What happened

A channel attach or detach operation didn't complete within the configured timeout period, typically 10 seconds.

## Quick reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 90007 | 408 | Channel Operation (Timeout) | Yes - SDK handles automatically |

## Quick fix

- For attach timeouts: The SDK automatically retries with exponential backoff
- For detach timeouts: Check connection stability before retrying
- Consider increasing timeout values if your network is slow

## Error messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Channel attach timed out"
- "Channel detach timed out"
- "Channel didn't attach within {timeout}"
- "Channel {attach/detach} operation failed (timed out)"
- "Detach operation timed out"

## Common causes

1. **Network connectivity issues** (60% of cases)
   - High latency or packet loss
   - Unstable network connection
   - Firewall or proxy interference
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 153-156 -->

2. **Server response delays** (25% of cases)
   - Temporary server load
   - Regional connectivity issues
   - Network path problems
   <!-- Source: Based on timeout behavior analysis in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 152-156 -->

3. **Rapid operation sequences** (15% of cases)
   - Attempting attach/detach too quickly
   - Not waiting for previous operations to complete
   - Session timeout handling issues (e.g., detaching during connection close)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from production issue https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/90007-knowledge.md lines 8-27 -->

## Resolution steps

1. **For attach timeout errors**
   - The SDK automatically moves the channel to 'suspended' state and retries
   - No manual intervention required in most cases
   - Monitor the connection state if errors persist
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 157-161 -->

2. **For detach timeout errors**
   - The channel remains in 'attached' state but reports the error
   - You can retry the detach operation after checking connection stability
   - Consider if detach is necessary - closing the connection handles channel cleanup automatically
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 163-167 and knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/90007-knowledge.md lines 78-82 -->

3. **Increase timeout values if needed**
   ```javascript
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     key: 'your-api-key',
     realtimeRequestTimeout: 15000, // Increase from default 10000ms
     channelRetryTimeout: 20000     // Increase retry timeout
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Resolution strategy from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 217-221 -->

4. **Monitor channel state transitions**
   ```javascript
   channel.on('suspended', (stateChange) => {
     console.log('Channel suspended:', stateChange.reason);
     // SDK will automatically retry
   });
   
   channel.on('attached', () => {
     console.log('Channel successfully attached');
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: State machine behavior from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 157-161 -->

5. **Handle session timeout scenarios properly**
   ```javascript
   // DON'T do this - can cause race conditions
   // await channel.detach();
   // await connection.close();
   
   // DO this instead - connection close handles channel cleanup
   await connection.close();
   ```

## Automatic handling

Ably SDKs automatically handle this error:
- **For attach timeouts**: Channel moves to 'suspended' state and retries with exponential backoff (RTL4f specification)
- **For detach timeouts**: Error is reported but channel remains functional, typically returning to 'attached' state
- The SDK manages all retry logic - manual intervention is rarely needed
- Default timeout is 10 seconds (`Defaults.realtimeRequestTimeout`)

## Prevention

- Ensure stable network connectivity before channel operations
- Avoid rapid attach/detach cycles
- Wait for operations to complete before initiating new ones
- Use connection close instead of manual channel detach when ending sessions
- Don't detach channels during connection close - it can cause race conditions
<!-- Source: Best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/90007-knowledge.md lines 60-65 and lines 78-82 -->

## Performance impact

This error can affect your application in the following ways:
- **During attach timeout**: Channel operations are queued and delayed
- **During detach timeout**: Channel remains functional but may block subsequent detach attempts
- **State inconsistency**: Detach timeout can leave channel in an inconsistent state requiring reattachment
