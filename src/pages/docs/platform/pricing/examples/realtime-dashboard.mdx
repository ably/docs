title: Realtime dashboard
meta_description: "Calculate Pub/Sub pricing for healthcare patient monitoring dashboards. Example shows real-time vitals tracking for 100 patients monitored by 5 care coordinators, with total cost of ~$98/month including presence and history features."
meta_keywords: "healthcare dashboard, patient monitoring, real-time vitals, healthcare IoT, care coordination, patient monitoring devices, clinical dashboard, realtime healthcare data, Pub/Sub pricing, Ably healthcare"
intro: "This Pub/Sub example demonstrates consumption-based pricing for a realtime dashboard – many data sources publishing to a small number of viewers."

For this example, we're using a healthcare scenario (patient vitals → care coordinators), but the same pattern applies to any dashboard with high inbound volume and low fan-out: IoT sensor monitoring, logistics tracking, infrastructure observability, etc.

### Assumptions
The scale and features used in this calculation.

| Scale | Features |
|-------|----------|
| 100 patients with home monitoring devices | ✓ Presence (shift handover visibility) |
| 5 care coordinators viewing dashboard | ✓ History retrieval (late joiners see recent readings) |
| 8-hour monitoring shifts, 22 days/month | |
| Vitals transmitted every 10 seconds (6 per minute) | |
| 15 clinical alerts per patient per day | |

### Cost summary
The high-level cost breakdown for this scenario.

| Item | Calculation | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Messages | 38.24M × $2.50/M | $95.60 |
| Connection minutes | 1.11M × $1.00/M | $1.11 |
| Channel minutes | 1.11M × $1.00/M | $1.11 |
| Presence & history | ~6,600 messages | Less than $0.02 |
| Package fee |  | [See plans](/pricing) |
| **Total** |  | **~$98/month** |

### Message breakdown
Patient devices transmit vitals (heart rate, SpO2, blood pressure) every 10 seconds, plus clinical alerts when readings breach thresholds. Each message is delivered to all 5 care coordinators subscribed to the monitoring channel.

| Message type | Calculation | Monthly |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Vitals updates (inbound) | 100 patients × 6/min × 480 mins × 22 days | 6.34M |
| Clinical alerts (inbound) | 100 patients × 15/day × 22 days | 33K |
| **Total inbound** |  | **6.37M** |
| Outbound to care team | 6.37M × 5 coordinators | 31.87M |
| **Total messages** |  | **38.24M** |

**Message cost:** 38.24M × $2.50/M = **$95.60**

### Connection and channel minutes
How connection and channel minute costs are calculated.

| Metric | Calculation | Monthly | Cost |
|--------|-------------|---------|------|
| Patient device connections | 100 × 8 hrs × 22 days × 60 mins | 1.06M | $1.06 |
| Care coordinator connections | 5 × 8 hrs × 22 days × 60 mins | 52.8K | $0.05 |
| **Total connection minutes** |  | **1.11M** | **$1.11** |
| Channel minutes | 105 users × 8 hrs × 22 days × 60 mins | 1.11M | $1.11 |

### Presence and history

These features add negligible cost at this scale but provide important clinical functionality. Presence shows which coordinators are actively monitoring during shift changes, while history lets late joiners see recent readings.

| Feature | Calculation | Monthly messages |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Presence events | 5 coordinators × 2 events × 22 days | 220 inbound |
| Presence fan-out | 220 × 4 other coordinators | 880 outbound |
| History retrieval | 5 coordinators × 1 request/shift × 22 days × 50 msgs | 5,500 |
| **Total** |  | **~6,600** |

**Total cost:** ~6,600 messages × $2.50/M = **~$0.02**
