This is a test page to demonstrate the stepped sidebar functionality. Follow these numbered steps to get started with Ably Chat.

## Introduction

Before diving into the setup process, let's understand what Ably Chat provides and why you might want to use it.

## <span data-step="1">Create a client</span>


First, you need to create an Ably Chat client instance. This client will be used to interact with the Ably Chat API.

```javascript
import * as Ably from 'ably';
import { ChatClient } from '@ably/chat';

const realtimeClient = new Ably.Realtime({
  key: 'your-api-key',
  clientId: 'unique-client-id'
});

const chatClient = new ChatClient(realtimeClient);
```

The client ID should be a unique identifier for the user. This is used to track which messages belong to which users.

## <span data-step="2">Connect to a room</span>

Once you have a client, you can connect to a chat room. Rooms are the main way to organize conversations in Ably Chat.

```javascript
const room = await chatClient.rooms.get('my-chat-room', {
  presence: { enableEvents: true },
  typing: { heartbeatThrottleMs: 5000 }
});

await room.attach();
```

The room ID can be any string that uniquely identifies your room. If the room doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

### Room configuration options Room configuration options Room configuration options Room configuration options

You can configure various features when creating a room:

- **Presence**: Track who is currently in the room
- **Typing indicators**: Show when users are typing
- **Occupancy**: Track the number of users in the room
- **Reactions**: Enable emoji reactions to messages

## <span data-step="3">Send messages</span>

Now that you're connected to a room, you can start sending messages:

```javascript
await room.messages.send({ text: 'Hello, world!' });
```

You can also send messages with additional metadata:

```javascript
await room.messages.send({
  text: 'Hello!',
  metadata: {
    type: 'greeting',
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
});
```

## <span data-step="4">Subscribe to messages</span>

To receive messages from other users, you need to subscribe to the room's message events:

```javascript
const { unsubscribe } = room.messages.subscribe((message) => {
  console.log('Received message:', message.text);
  console.log('From:', message.clientId);
  console.log('At:', message.timestamp);
});

// Later, when you want to stop receiving messages
unsubscribe();
```

The subscription will continue to receive messages until you call the `unsubscribe` function.

## <span data-step="5">Add presence tracking</span>

Presence tracking allows you to see who is currently in the room and track their status:

```javascript
// Enter the room's presence set
await room.presence.enter({ status: 'online' });

// Subscribe to presence updates
room.presence.subscribe((presenceEvent) => {
  console.log('Presence update:', presenceEvent.action);
  console.log('User:', presenceEvent.clientId);
  console.log('Data:', presenceEvent.data);
});

// Update your presence data
await room.presence.update({ status: 'away' });

// Leave the room's presence set
await room.presence.leave();
```

## Additional features

Beyond the core functionality, Ably Chat provides several additional features to enhance your chat experience.

### Typing indicators

Show when users are currently typing in the room:

```javascript
// Start typing
await room.typing.start();

// Subscribe to typing events
room.typing.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log(`${event.clientId} is typing`);
});

// Stop typing
await room.typing.stop();
```

### Room reactions

Allow users to send quick emoji reactions:

```javascript
// Send a reaction
await room.reactions.send({ type: 'like' });

// Subscribe to reactions
room.reactions.subscribe((reaction) => {
  console.log(`${reaction.clientId} sent: ${reaction.type}`);
});
```
