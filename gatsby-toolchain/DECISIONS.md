# Decisions

This file is for recording key decisions & their reasoning, to ensure that people can be confident that if there is no decision here and something seems wrong, it should be fine to make the alteration.

## Folder Structure
- .textile documents from the current codebase should be placed in textile/nanoc-compatible, namespaced in Gatsby to `textile-nanoc-compatible` to allow us flexibility in case we want to support or transform different textile documents in a different way.
- partials should be stored in /partials/shared to allow us flexibility in case we want to support partials in a different way.
