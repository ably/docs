Starting with iOS 15, Apple supports a power-efficient way to request location through the location push service extension.

To receive location push notifications:

# Request a location-specific device token by calling @CLLocationManager.startMonitoringLocationPushes(completion:)@ within the @ARTPushRegistererDelegate.didActivateAblyPush(:)@ delegate method. This delegate method is the callback for @ARTRealtime.push.activate()@.
# Register the token with Ably by calling @ARTPush.didRegisterForLocationNotifications(withDeviceToken:realtime:)@ when you receive the location push token. Note the "Location" in the method name to distinguish it from regular push tokens.
# Handle the registration result through the @ARTPushRegistererDelegate.didUpdateAblyPush:@ callback, which indicates whether the token was successfully saved.
