title:  Message Storage
meta_description: "Explore the different ways Ably can handle Message Storage"

---

By default Ably will store messages for just two minutes so that they can be retrieved with the "History API":/storage-history/history in the event of a lost connection. However, there are a number of options available to increase this storage time. You can persist all of your messages (typically for 24 hours), persist the last message using the "channel rewind":/channels/options/rewind option, or use "integrations":/integrations to persist messages externally. 


h2(#default-persistence). Default message storage - two minutes

Accounts with the default message storage of two minutes can use the History API to recover messages in the original order they were sent, and applies to both "regular channel messages":/realtime/messages and "presence messages":/realtime/presence. For brief disconnections Ably automatically sends lost messages via the live subscription.

The following diagram illustrates the default persistence of messages:

</a>

Read more about the "History API":/storage-history/history or the "Realtime connection state recovery":/realtime/connection/#connection-state-recovery.


h2(#all-message-persistence). Persist all messages - 24 or 72 hours

If you need to retain messages for longer than the default two minutes you can enable "persisted history" when setting a "channel rule":/general/channel-rules-namespaces. When "persisted history is enabled":#persisted-history for a channel any messages will be stored on disk for 24 for free tiers or 72 hours for paid tiers.

In this scenario, the History API can be used to retrieve the persisted messages. This is illustrated in the following diagram:

<a href="/images/diagrams/history-persist-all-messages.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/diagrams/history-persist-all-messages.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Persist All Messages">
</a>

Every message that is persisted to, or retrieved from, disk counts as an extra message towards your monthly quota. For example, with persistence enabled a published message counts as two messages for your monthly quota. If the message is then retrieved another message will be deducted from your monthly quota.

To enable history on a channel add a @persist all messages@ "channel rule":/general/channel-rules-namespaces in the settings of your Ably "dashboard":https://ably.com/dashboard.

    </a>


h2(#persist-last-message). Persist last message - 365 days

You can also choose to persist just "the last message":/general/channel-rules-namespaces on a channel, which persists the last published message for one year. 

This message is not retrieved using the History API, you must use the "channel rewind":/channels/options/rewind mechanism, attached to a channel with @rewind=1@. Note that only regular channel messages can be stored, not presence messages. 

This option for persistence is illustrated in the following diagram:

    </a>


h2(#outside-persistence). Store messages outside of Ably

The final option for persisting messages is to use integrations to store your messages outside of Ably. With integrations you can set up external webhooks so messages sent to a channel notify HTTP endpoints, serverless functions or other services for each event. 

For example you can set up an integration rule triggering an action that notifies and copies data to a third party storage system for persistence when a message is sent.

Visit the "Integrations section":/integrations to see the available options for sending messages externally.
