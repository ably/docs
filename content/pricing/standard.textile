Note that volume discounts reset every month.

h2(#limits). Limits

"Compare the limits":/pricing/limits associated with each package to see those available on the Standard package.

h2(#support). Support

Standard package support includes access to Ably support via email with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of less than 1 business day for general guidance and for system impediments or system down.

h2(#upgrade). Upgrade

To upgrade your account from a Standard package:

1. Ensure you are the "account owner":/account/users.
2. Log in to your "account":https://ably.com/login and select *Billing* from the *Account* menu.
3. Choose the plan you wish to upgrade to and follow the instructions. Upgrades take effect immediately.

The base package price will be charged pro-rata from the point in the month that you upgraded. This is true for the current Standard package base price, as well as the upgraded "Pro package":/pricing/pro base price.

h2(#downgrade). Downgrade

To downgrade your account from a Standard package to a Free package:

1. Ensure you are the "account owner":/account/users.
2. Log in to your "account":https://ably.com/login and select *Billing* from the *Account* menu.
3. Click the *Downgrade* button.

If you downgrade to a "Free package":/pricing/free, you will finish the month on the Standard package with its associated limits and benefits. At the beginning of the following month you will receive a final invoice covering your last month's consumption. Once the final invoice has been paid, your payment details are removed from the system.

If you wish to cancel your account, downgrade to the Free package first and then have the account owner "contact us":https://ably.com/support. Be aware that this will permanently delete all the information associated with your account.
