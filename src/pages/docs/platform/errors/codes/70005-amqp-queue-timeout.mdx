# Error 70005: AMQP queue timeout

## What Happened

Ably couldn't deliver a message to your AMQP queue integration because the delivery operation timed out.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 70005 | 500 | Server Error (Integration) | Yes - temporary integration issue |

## Quick Fix

- Check your AMQP broker is responsive and not overloaded
- Verify network connectivity between Ably and your queue
- Monitor queue depth and consumer processing speed

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Timeout sending message to queue"

## Common Causes

1. **AMQP broker performance issues** (40% of cases)
   - High load on the message broker
   - Slow message processing
   - Resource constraints
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/70005-knowledge.md lines 11-12 -->

2. **Network connectivity problems** (30% of cases)
   - High latency between Ably and your broker
   - Intermittent network issues
   - Firewall blocking connections
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/70005-knowledge.md lines 12-14 -->

3. **Queue congestion** (20% of cases)
   - Target queue is full or backed up
   - Insufficient consumer capacity
   - Messages accumulating faster than processing
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/70005-knowledge.md line 13 -->

4. **Configuration issues** (10% of cases)
   - Incorrect integration settings
   - Authentication delays
   - Wrong queue names or routing keys
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/70005-knowledge.md lines 15-16 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Check AMQP broker health**
   - Access your AMQP broker management console
   - Review broker performance metrics and logs
   - Verify CPU, memory, and disk usage are within normal ranges
   - Check queue depth and consumer activity
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/70005-knowledge.md lines 27-31 -->

2. **Verify network connectivity**
   - Test connectivity from Ably's regions to your AMQP endpoint
   - Check network latency using monitoring tools
   - Review firewall rules and security groups
   - Ensure Ably's IPs are whitelisted if required
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/70005-knowledge.md lines 33-36 -->

3. **Review integration configuration**
   - Navigate to your Ably Dashboard → Integrations
   - Verify AMQP connection settings and credentials
   - Confirm queue names and routing keys are correct
   - Check the configured timeout values
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/70005-knowledge.md lines 38-41 -->

4. **Optimize message flow**
   - Monitor message size and volume patterns
   - Identify peak load times
   - Scale your AMQP broker if needed
   - Add more consumers to process messages faster
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/70005-knowledge.md lines 43-46 -->

5. **Implement resilience measures**
   - Configure dead letter queues for failed messages
   - Set up appropriate retry policies
   - Monitor both Ably integration logs and broker metrics
   - Create alerts for queue depth thresholds
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/70005-knowledge.md lines 59-62 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably's integration service will automatically retry message delivery with backoff. However, persistent timeouts may require manual intervention to resolve the underlying issue.

## Prevention

- **Scale appropriately**: Ensure your AMQP broker can handle peak message volumes
- **Monitor proactively**: Set up alerts for queue depth and broker performance
- **Optimize network**: Use brokers in regions close to Ably's infrastructure
- **Plan capacity**: Size your queues and consumers for expected load
- **Keep messages small**: Use compression or batching for large payloads

- Missing: Specific timeout values and how to configure them for AMQP integrations
- Missing: List of Ably IP addresses that need whitelisting for AMQP connections
- Missing: Detailed troubleshooting guide for integration timeouts
- Impact: Makes it harder for users to proactively configure and troubleshoot AMQP integrations
- Recommendation: Add comprehensive AMQP integration troubleshooting guide with timeout configuration details
- Severity: Medium - users can work around this but it requires support contact
