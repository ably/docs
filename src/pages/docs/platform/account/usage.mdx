### Usage forecasting

Understand projected consumption:

- Current month forecast based on usage trends
- Growth rate analysis
- Seasonal pattern identification
- Capacity planning insights

## Usage analysis and insights

### Usage patterns

Identify consumption patterns:

1. Peak usage periods - When your applications are most active
2. Geographic distribution - Where your users are located
3. Application breakdown - Which apps consume the most resources
4. Feature utilization - Which Ably features are most heavily used

### Usage efficiency

Analyze usage effectiveness:

- Message delivery success rates
- Connection stability metrics
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Cost per message or connection

### Trend analysis

Understand usage evolution:

- Growth trends over time
- Seasonal variations in usage
- Impact of application changes on consumption
- Correlation between features and usage

## Managing usage data

### Usage optimization

To optimize your consumption:

1. Identify inefficiencies in message patterns or connection handling
2. Optimize message frequency to reduce unnecessary traffic
3. Implement batching for multiple small messages
4. Review connection lifecycle management

### Usage planning

Use usage data for planning:

1. Capacity planning - Predict future resource needs
2. Budget planning - Estimate future costs based on trends
3. Application scaling - Understand usage impact of growth
4. Feature planning - Prioritize features based on usage patterns

### Usage alerts

Set up monitoring for:

- Unusual usage spikes that might indicate issues
- Approaching plan limits or quotas
- Unexpected changes in usage patterns
- Cost threshold notifications
