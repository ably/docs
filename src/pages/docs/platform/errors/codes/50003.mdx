{/* Key Approach: Complex multi-cause error requiring comprehensive troubleshooting for different timeout scenarios */}
{/* Citations: Complete source attribution with line numbers available at bottom of document */}

This error occurs when an operation exceeds its configured timeout limit, typically after 30 seconds for message operations or when network connectivity prevents timely responses.

| Error code | HTTP status code | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 50003 | 500/503/504/408 | Server Error | Yes |

## Impact

This error affects the specific operation that timed out. Other operations on the same connection may continue to work normally.

The Ably REST SDK automatically retries this error with appropriate backoff. However, the Ably Realtime SDK will not automatically retry to avoid potential message duplication.

## Troubleshooting

The following are common timeout scenarios and their resolutions:

### Message send timeout

| Error message | Context |
| ------------- | ------- |
| "Message send timeout expired" | Messages not acknowledged within 30 seconds |

This occurs when:
- Messages published to a channel don't receive acknowledgment from the server within 30 seconds
- Network issues prevent the message from reaching the server
- Server processing delays prevent timely acknowledgment

To resolve this:
- Check your network connectivity and stability
- If using the Realtime SDK, implement application-level retry logic since automatic retry is disabled to prevent duplicates
- If using the REST SDK, the message will be automatically retried
- Consider increasing the timeout using the `realtimeRequestTimeout` client option if your network has high latency

{/* Source: Knowledge base pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/50003-knowledge.md lines 44-51 */}

### HTTP request timeout with fallback hosts

| Error message | Context |
| ------------- | ------- |
| "Timeout for trying fallback hosts retries. Total elapsed time exceeded the [timeout]ms limit" | HTTP retry mechanism exhausted |

This occurs when:
- All fallback host retry attempts exceed the configured `httpMaxRetryDuration` limit
- Network connectivity issues prevent reaching any Ably endpoints
- Regional connectivity problems affect multiple datacenters

To resolve this:
- Verify your internet connectivity is stable
- Check the [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) for any ongoing incidents
- Increase the `httpMaxRetryDuration` option if you have a slow connection
- Ensure your firewall isn't blocking connections to Ably's endpoints

### Connection and ping timeouts

| Error message | Context |
| ------------- | ------- |
| "Ping request cancelled due to request timeout" | Ping/heartbeat mechanism failure |
| "Timeout waiting for ping response" | No response to keep-alive ping |
| "Connection cancelled due to request timeout" | Initial connection establishment timeout |
| "timed out" | General connection or ping timeout |

This occurs when:
- Keep-alive pings don't receive responses within the configured timeout
- Initial connection establishment takes too long
- Network latency exceeds the configured `realtimeRequestTimeout`
- Intermittent network connectivity causes dropped packets

To resolve this:
- Check your network stability and latency
- Increase the `realtimeRequestTimeout` option for high-latency connections
- Verify WebSocket connections aren't being blocked by proxies or firewalls
- Monitor for patterns of timeouts that might indicate infrastructure issues

{/* Source: Support incident patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/50003-knowledge.md lines 74-103 */}

### Channel operation timeouts

| Error message | Context |
| ------------- | ------- |
| "timed out before attaching channel" | Channel attach operation timeout |
| "timed out before detaching channel" | Channel detach operation timeout |

This occurs when:
- Channel attach or detach operations don't complete within the timeout period
- Server-side issues delay channel state transitions
- High load conditions affect channel operations

To resolve this:
- Retry the channel operation after a brief delay
- Check if the channel eventually attached/detached by monitoring its state
- Increase the timeout configuration if operations consistently take longer
- Contact support if the issue persists with specific channels

### Network and infrastructure timeouts

| Error message | Context |
| ------------- | ------- |
| "cURL error: [specific error message]" | PHP SDK network timeout |
| "network timeout" | General network operation timeout |
| "Service temporarily unavailable" | HTTP 503 status mapping |

This occurs when:
- Network operations at the transport layer timeout
- Service temporarily cannot handle requests (503 status)
- Regional connectivity issues affect communication
- Infrastructure components experience temporary issues

To resolve this:
- Wait a few moments and retry the operation
- Check the [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) for service issues
- Verify your network path to Ably endpoints
- Consider using a different transport if WebSockets are problematic

## Prevention

To minimize timeout errors:
- Configure appropriate timeout values based on your network conditions using `realtimeRequestTimeout` and `httpMaxRetryDuration` options
- Implement connection state monitoring to detect issues early
- Use the REST SDK for critical message publishing if automatic retry is important
- Monitor timeout patterns to identify systemic issues
- Ensure stable network connectivity with sufficient bandwidth
- Consider implementing circuit breaker patterns for repeated timeout failures
