Create and manage personal access tokens for the Ably Control API to programmatically interact with your account and applications.

Access tokens provide secure, programmatic access to Ably's Control API, allowing you to automate account and application management tasks.

## Accessing token management

To manage your access tokens:

1. Click Account in the top navigation bar
2. Select My Access Tokens from the dropdown menu
3. View and manage your personal access tokens

## Understanding access tokens

### What are access tokens

Access tokens are secure credentials that allow:

- Programmatic access to the Ably Control API
- Automation of account and application management
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines and scripts
- Administrative tasks without manual dashboard interaction

### Token capabilities

Access tokens can be configured with specific permissions:

| Capability | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Read account information | View account details and settings |
| Manage applications | Create, update, and delete applications |
| Configure API keys | Manage application API keys |
| Access statistics | Retrieve usage and performance data |
| Manage integrations | Configure webhooks and external services |
| User management | Add, remove, and modify user permissions |

### Token security

Important security characteristics:

- Tokens are displayed only once during creation
- Each token has specific, limited capabilities
- Tokens can be revoked immediately if compromised
- Token usage is logged for security auditing

## Creating access tokens

### Token creation process

To create a new access token:

1. Click Create new token on the access tokens page
2. Provide a descriptive name for the token
3. Select the account (if you have access to multiple accounts)
4. Choose specific capabilities for the token
5. Click Create token
6. Important: Copy and securely store the token immediately

### Token configuration options

When creating tokens, configure:

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Token name | Descriptive name for identification purposes |
| Account scope | Which account the token can access |
| Capabilities | Specific permissions granted to the token |
| Expiration | Optional expiration date for the token |

### Capability selection

Choose appropriate capabilities based on intended use:

- Minimal permissions - Grant only the capabilities needed
- Specific scope - Limit access to relevant resources
- Time-limited - Consider expiration dates for temporary use
- Purpose-specific - Create different tokens for different use cases

## Managing existing tokens

### Viewing token information

For each token, you can see:

| Information | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Token name | Descriptive name you provided |
| Created date | When the token was created |
| Last used | Most recent token usage (if any) |
| Capabilities | Permissions granted to the token |
| Status | Active or revoked status |

### Token operations

Available actions for existing tokens:

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| View details | See token capabilities and usage history |
| Regenerate | Create a new token with same permissions |
| Revoke | Immediately disable the token |
| Update name | Modify the descriptive name |

### Revoking tokens

To revoke an access token:

1. Find the token in your access tokens list
2. Click Revoke next to the token
3. Confirm the revocation
4. Note: This action is immediate and irreversible

## Using access tokens

### API authentication

Use tokens to authenticate with the Control API:

<Code>
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     https://control.ably.net/v1/accounts
```
</Code>

### Common use cases

Access tokens are typically used for:

| Use Case | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| CI/CD automation | Deploy and configure applications automatically |
| Infrastructure as code | Manage Ably resources through scripts |
| Monitoring integration | Fetch statistics for external monitoring |
| Bulk operations | Perform administrative tasks at scale |

### Integration examples

Example integrations using access tokens:

- Terraform - Manage Ably resources as infrastructure
- GitHub Actions - Automate deployment workflows
- Monitoring scripts - Collect usage data for analysis
- Administrative tools - Build custom management interfaces

## Access token security

### Storage best practices

Securely store access tokens:

- Never commit tokens to version control
- Use environment variables or secure secret stores
- Rotate tokens regularly for enhanced security
- Document token usage for team awareness

### Monitoring token usage

Track token security:

- Review token usage logs regularly
- Monitor for unexpected token activity
- Set up alerts for token usage anomalies
- Audit token permissions periodically

### Security incident response

If a token is compromised:

1. Immediately revoke the compromised token
2. Review logs to understand potential impact
3. Create new token if continued access is needed
4. Update systems with the new token
5. Document incident for future prevention

## Token management best practices

### Token lifecycle management

- Regular auditing - Review tokens quarterly
- Purpose documentation - Maintain clear records of token purposes
- Expiration planning - Set expiration dates where appropriate
- Team coordination - Ensure team members know about shared tokens

### Capability management

- Principle of least privilege - Grant minimal necessary permissions
- Purpose-specific tokens - Create separate tokens for different use cases
- Regular review - Ensure capabilities remain appropriate
- Documentation - Keep records of why capabilities were granted

### Integration maintenance

- Dependency tracking - Know which systems use which tokens
- Update procedures - Have processes for rotating tokens
- Backup plans - Prepare for token revocation scenarios
- Testing - Verify token functionality after changes

## Common token management tasks

### Rotating expired tokens

When tokens expire or need rotation:

1. Create a new token with the same capabilities
2. Update all systems using the old token
3. Test that new token works correctly
4. Revoke the old token
5. Document the rotation for team records

### Troubleshooting token issues

Common token problems and solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
| ----- | -------- |
| Authentication failures | Verify token is correct and not revoked |
| Permission errors | Check token capabilities match required operations |
| Rate limiting | Ensure token usage stays within API limits |
| Expired tokens | Create new tokens and update integrations |

### Token inventory management

Maintain an inventory of tokens:

- Document what each token is used for
- Track which systems and team members use each token
- Plan token rotation schedules
- Maintain emergency contact information for token owners

Access tokens provide powerful automation capabilities while requiring careful security management to protect your Ably account and applications.
