Ably clients can authenticate with Ably in one of two ways. They can use "Basic Authentication":/core-features/authentication#basic-authentication or "Token Authentication":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication. Basic Authentication makes use of the customer's "API key":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key) to connect with Ably. Token Authentication requires a server to provide an "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#tokens, an "Ably @TokenRequest@":#request-token, an "Ably JWT (JSON Web Token)":/core-features/authentication#ably-jwt, or an "External JWT":https://jwt.io with an embedded Ably-compatible token to the client. "Token Authentication":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication, in most cases, is the recommended strategy due to it providing robust access control and stringent security measures.

h2(#understanding-auth). Understanding the Ably authentication schemes

This page of documentation is intended to describe the Realtime Authentication API and is not intended to explain in depth how Ably's authentication works. If you are new to Ably and/or the authentication schemes, we strongly recommend that you get acquainted with the following first:

* "Getting started with Ably's authentication":/core-features/authentication/#getting-started
* "Selecting the right authentication scheme":/core-features/authentication/#selecting-auth
* "Basic Authentication explained":/core-features/authentication/#basic-authentication

h3. Tutorials

If you're the kind of person who prefers to dive into code, we have "client-server authentication tutorials":/tutorials.

h2(#basic-authentication). Basic Authentication

*Basic Authentication* uses one of the "api keys":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key "configured via the application dashboard":https://faqs.ably.com/setting-up-and-managing-api-keys as the authentication token. Basic Authentication is the simplest method to use but has some important limitations described in detail in the "Basic Authentication documentation":/core-features/authentication/#basic-authentication.

Here is a straightforward example of using Basic Authentication to connect to Ably:

```[jsall](code-editor:realtime/connection)
  var realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}' });
```

```[ruby]
  realtime = Ably::Realtime.new(key: '{{API_KEY}}')
```

```[java]
  ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions();
  options.key = "{{API_KEY}}";
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime(options);
```

```[swift]
  let realtime = ARTRealtime(key: "{{API_KEY}}")
```

```[objc]
  ARTRealtime *realtime = [[ARTRealtime alloc] initWithKey:@"{{API_KEY}}"];
```

```[csharp]
  AblyRealtime realtime = AblyRealtime("{{API_KEY}}");
```

h2(#token-authentication). Token Authentication

p(tip). Look at the "general authentication documentation":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication for more in-depth information on Token Authentication.

*Token Authentication* uses an Ably-compatible token to authenticate with Ably. This can be an "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#tokens obtained via the REST API <span lang="default">"@requestToken@":#request-token</span><span lang="csharp">"@RequestToken@":#request-token</span><span lang="ruby">"@request_token@":#request-token</span> endpoint, an "Ably JWT":/core-features/authentication#ably-jwt signed by your API key, or an "External JWT":https://jwt.io object "with an embedded Ably-compatible token":/core-features/authentication#jwt-embed-process. Tokens are authentication credentials that are short-lived, and therefore they may more readily be distributed to clients where there is a risk of compromise. Tokens may also be issued with a particular scope - such as a limited set of "access rights or capabilities":/core-features/authentication#capabilities-explained or being limited to use by a specific "<span lang="default">@clientId@</span><span lang="csharp">@ClientId@</span> identity":#identified-clients - and therefore token-based authentication provides the flexibility to implement access and identity control policies in the application. See the "Token Authentication documentation":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication for more details. To initialize the "Realtime library":/api/realtime-sdk/constructor to a previously obtained "@Ably Token@":#token-details or "@Ably JWT@":/core-features/authentication#ably-jwt,  set the <span lang="ruby">@:token@ or @:token_details@</span><span lang="python">@token@ or @token_details@</span><span lang="csharp">@Token@ or @TokenDetails@</span><span lang="default">@token@ or @tokenDetails@</span> attribute of "@ClientOptions@":/api/rest-sdk#client-options to said token.

Below is a rather contrived yet straightforward example that instances a Realtime library using "Token Authentication":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication with a means to reissue tokens as required. Typically, in a browser environment, the <span lang="default">"@authUrl@":#auth-options</span><span lang="csharp">"@AuthUrl@":#auth-options</span> provided would be a relative URL to a local endpoint that is used to issue tokens to trusted clients. Client requests can, for example, be trusted based on session cookies. For non-browser clients, an authentication callback is preferred thus relying on your application to communicate securely with your own servers to obtain a token.

```[jsall](code-editor:realtime/auth-token-callback)
  var realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ authUrl: 'http://my.website/auth' });
```

```[ruby]
  realtime = Ably::Realtime.new(auth_url: 'http://my.website/auth')
```

```[java]
  ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions();
  options.authUrl = "http://my.website/auth";
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime(options);
```

```[objc]
  ARTClientOptions *options = [[ARTClientOptions alloc] init];
  options.authUrl = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://my.website/auth"];
  ARTRealtime *realtime = [[ARTRealtime alloc] initWithOptions:options];
```

```[swift]
  let options = ARTClientOptions()
  options.authUrl = NSURL(string: "http://my.website/auth")
  let realtime = ARTRealtime(options: options)
```

```[csharp]
  ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions();
  options.AuthUrl = new Uri("http://my.website/auth");
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime(options);
```

h2(#selecting-auth). Selecting an authentication mechanism

<%= partial partial_version('core-features/_authentication_comparison') %>

h2(#identified-clients). Identified clients

When a client is authenticated and connected to Ably, they are considered to be an *authenticated client*. However, whilst an *authenticated client* has a verifiable means to authenticate with Ably, they do not necessarily have an identity. When a client is assigned a trusted identity (i.e. a <span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":#token-details</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":#token-details</span><span lang="default">"@clientId@":#token-details</span>), then they are considered to be an *identified client* and for all operations they perform with the Ably service, their <span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":#token-details</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":#token-details</span><span lang="default">"@clientId@":#token-details</span> field will be automatically populated and can be trusted by other clients.

We encourage customers to always issue tokens to clients so that they authenticate using the short-lived token and do not have access to a customer's private API keys. Since the customer can then control the <span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":#token-details</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":#token-details</span><span lang="default">"@clientId@":#token-details</span> that may be used by any of its clients, all other clients can rely on the validity of the <span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":#token-details</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":#token-details</span><span lang="default">"@clientId@":#token-details</span> in published messages and of members present in presence channels.

The following example demonstrates how to issue an Ably "@TokenRequest@":#request-token with an explicit <span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":#token-details</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":#token-details</span><span lang="default">"@clientId@":#token-details</span> that, when used by a client, will then be considered an *identified client*.


```[jsall](code-editor:realtime/auth-client-id)
  var realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}' });
  realtime.auth.createTokenRequest({ clientId: 'Bob' }, function(err, tokenRequest) {
    /* ... issue the TokenRequest to a client ... */
  })
```

```[ruby]
  realtime = Ably::Realtime.new(key: '{{API_KEY}}')
  realtime.auth.createTokenRequest(client_id: 'Bob') do |token_request|
    # ... issue the TokenRequest to a client ...
  end
```

```[java]
  ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions();
  options.key = "{{API_KEY}}";
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime(options);
  TokenParams tokenParams = new TokenParams();
  tokenParams.clientId = "Bob";
  TokenRequest tokenRequest;
  tokenRequest = realtime.auth.createTokenRequest(tokenParams, null);
  /* ... issue the TokenRequest to a client ... */
```

```[csharp]
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime("{{API_KEY}}");
  TokenParams tokenParams = new TokenParams {ClientId = "Bob"};
  string tokenRequest = await realtime.Auth.CreateTokenRequestAsync(tokenParams);
  /* ... issue the TokenRequest to a client ... */
```

```[objc]
  ARTRealtime *realtime = [[ARTRealtime alloc] initWithKey:@"{{API_KEY}}"];
  ARTTokenParams *tokenParams = [[ARTTokenParams alloc] initWithClientId:@"Bob"];
  [realtime.auth createTokenRequest:tokenParams options:nil
                 callback:^(ARTTokenRequest *tokenRequest NSError *error) {
      // ... issue the TokenRequest to a client ...
  }];
```

```[swift]
  let realtime = ARTRealtime(key: "{{API_KEY}}")
  let tokenParams = ARTTokenParams(clientId: "Bob")
  realtime.auth.createTokenRequest(tokenParams, options: nil) { tokenRequest, error in
      // ... issue the TokenRequest to a client ...
  }
```

Instructs the library to get a new token immediately. Once fetched, it will upgrade the current realtime connection to use the new token, or if not connected, will initiate a connection to Ably once the new token has been obtained. Also stores any <span lang="ruby">@token_params@ and @auth_options@</span><span lang="default">@tokenParams@ and @authOptions@</span> passed in as the new defaults, to be used for all subsequent implicit or explicit token requests.

Any <span lang="ruby">@token_params@ and @auth_options@</span><span lang="default">@tokenParams@ and @authOptions@</span> objects passed in will entirely replace (as opposed to being merged with) the currently client library saved <span lang="ruby">@token_params@ and @auth_options@</span><span lang="default">@tokenParams@ and @authOptions@</span>.

  h4. Callback result

  On success, the callback will be called with the new "@TokenDetails@":#token-details object only once the realtime connection has been successfully upgraded to use the new token.

  On failure to obtain an token or upgrade the token, the connection will move to the @SUSPENDED@ or @FAILED@ state, and the callback will be called with  @err@ containing an @NSError@ object with the error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.

  The @authorize@ callback can therefore be used to only trigger an event once the new token has taken effect. This can be useful if, for example, you want to do attach to a new channel following a new channel capability being applied to the connection.

blang[jsall].
  h4. Callback result

  On success, the callback will be called with the new "@TokenDetails@":#token-details only once the realtime connection has been successfully upgraded to use the new token.

  On failure to obtain a token or upgrade the token, the connection will move to the @SUSPENDED@ or @FAILED@ state, and the callback will be called with @err@ containing an "@ErrorInfo@":/realtime/types#error-info object with the error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.

  The @authorize@ callback can be used to trigger an event once the new token has taken effect. This can be useful if, for example, you want to do attach to a new channel following a new channel capability being applied to the connection.

blang[java].
  h4. Returns

  On success, a new "@TokenDetails@":#token-details is returned only once the realtime connection has been successfully upgraded to use the new "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens.

  On failure to obtain a token or upgrade the token, the connection will move to the @SUSPENDED@ or @FAILED@ state and an "@AblyException@":#ably-exception will be raised with the error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.

  The synchronous @authorize@ method can therefore be used to run subsequent code only once the new token has taken effect. This can be useful if, for example, you want to do attach to a new channel following a new channel capability being applied to the connection.

blang[csharp].
  h4. Returns

  Returns a @Task<TokenDetails>@ which needs to be awaited.

  On success, a new "@TokenDetails@":#token-details is returned only once the realtime connection has been successfully upgraded to use the new token.

  On failure to obtain a token or upgrade the token, the connection will move to the @SUSPENDED@ or @FAILED@ state and an "@AblyException@":#ably-exception will be raised with the error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.

  By waiting for the @authorize@ method return value, it can be used to run subsequent code only once the new token has taken effect. This can be useful if, for example, you want to do attach to a new channel following a new channel capability being applied to the connection.

blang[ruby].
  h4. Returns

  A "@Deferrable@":/realtime/types#deferrable object is returned from this method.

  On success, the registered success callbacks for the "@Deferrable@":/realtime/types#deferrable and any block provided to this method yields a "@TokenDetails@":#token-details only once the realtime connection has been successfully upgraded to use the new token.

  On failure to obtain a token or upgrade the token, the connection will move to the @SUSPENDED@ or @FAILED@ state, triggering the @errback@ callbacks of the "@Deferrable@":/realtime/types#deferrable with an "@ErrorInfo@":#error-info object with the error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.

  The @authorize@ callbacks can therefore be used to trigger an event once the new "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens has taken effect. This can be useful if, for example, you want to do attach to a new channel following a new channel capability being applied to the connection.

Creates and signs an Ably "@TokenRequest@":#request-token based on the specified (or if none specified, the client library stored) <span lang="ruby">@token_params@ and @auth_options@</span><span lang="default">@tokenParams@ and @authOptions@</span>. Note this can only be used when the "API @key@":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key value is available locally. Otherwise, the Ably "@TokenRequest@":#request-token must be obtained from the key owner. Use this to generate Ably "@TokenRequests@":#request-token in order to implement an "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens request callback for use by other clients.

Both <span lang="ruby">@auth_options@ and @token_params@</span><span lang="default">@authOptions@ and @tokenParams@</span> are optional. When omitted or @null@, the default token parameters and authentication options for the client library are used, as specified in the @ClientOptions@ when the client library was instantiated, or later updated with an explicit "<span lang="default">@authorize@</span><span lang="csharp">@Authorize@</span>":#authorize request.  Values passed in will be used instead of (rather than being merged with) the default values.

To understand why an Ably "@TokenRequest@":#request-token may be issued to clients in favor of a token, see "Token Authentication explained":/core-features/authentication/#token-authentication.

Both <span lang="ruby">@auth_options@ and @token_params@</span><span lang="default">@authOptions@ and @tokenParams@</span> are optional. When omitted or @null@, the default token parameters and authentication options for the client library are used, as specified in the @ClientOptions@ when the client library was instantiated, or later updated with an explicit "<span lang="default">@authorize@</span><span lang="csharp">@Authorize@</span>":#authorize request.  Values passed in will be used instead of (rather than being merged with) the default values.

To understand why an Ably "@TokenRequest@":#request-token may be issued to clients in favor of a token, see "Token Authentication explained":/core-features/authentication/#token-authentication.

  h4. Callback result

  On success, @tokenDetails@ contains a "@TokenDetails@":#token-details object containing the details of the new "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens along with the @token@ string.

  On failure to obtain an "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens, @err@ contains an <span lang="default">"@ErrorInfo@":#error-info</span><span lang="objc,swift">@NSError@</span> object with an error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.

blang[java].
  h4. Returns

  On success, a "@TokenDetails@":#token-details object containing the details of the new "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens along with the @token@ string is returned.

  Failure to obtain an "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens will raise an "@AblyException@":#ably-exception.

blang[csharp].
  h4. Returns

  Returns a @Task<TokenDetails>@ which needs to be awaited.

  On success, a "@TokenDetails@":#token-details object containing the details of the new "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens along with the @token@ string is returned.

  Failure to obtain an "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens will raise an "@AblyException@":#ably-exception.

blang[ruby].
  h4. Returns

  A "@Deferrable@":/realtime/types#deferrable object is returned from this method.

  On success, the registered success callbacks for the "@Deferrable@":/realtime/types#deferrable and any block provided to this method yields a "@TokenDetails@":#token-details object containing the details of the new "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens along with the @token@ string.

  Failure to obtain an "Ably Token":/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens will trigger the errback callbacks of the "@Deferrable@":/realtime/types#deferrable with an "@ErrorInfo@":#error-info object containing an error response as defined in the "Ably REST API":/rest-api#common documentation.
