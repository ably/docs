## Cost breakdown

The following breakdown shows the cost of connections, channels and messages in this scenario.

### How messages are counted

Every chat message counts as a billable message. Messages are counted when they're sent to Ably and when they're delivered to users. Usage is billed in increments of one million messages, rounded up.

A support agent sends one message to a customer it equals three messages (one sent to Ably + one received by the customer + one echoed back to the agent).

In 1:1 chat, there's no fan-out - each message goes to one recipient.
