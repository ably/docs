* Fanout Cloud supports SSL for nearly all methods of connectivity. The built-in realm domains (i.e. @{realm-id}.fanoutcdn.com@)can be accessed with either @http/ws@ or  @https/wss@ schemes.
* For custom domains, it’s possible to upload your own certificate to be used for SSL. Fanout Cloud supports TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) so that a dedicated IP address is not needed for SSL.
* For traffic proxied to origin servers, it’s possible to specify origin server settings for SSL and non-SSL traffic. If both are provided, then Fanout Cloud will use whichever one matches the scheme of an incoming request.
* URLs subscribed to receive Webhooks may use either @http@ or @https@.
