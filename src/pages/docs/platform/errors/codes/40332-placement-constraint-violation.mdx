# Error 40332: Placement Constraint Violation

## What Happened

Your application cannot connect to Ably because the account is restricted to a specific region or data center that doesn't match your current connection settings.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40332 | 403 | Client Error (Placement Constraint) | No - requires configuration fix |

## Quick Fix

- Verify you're using the correct regional endpoint for your account
- Check if your account has region-specific constraints (EU, China, APAC)
- Ensure your SDK configuration includes the custom environment provided

## Error Messages

You may see this exact message:
- "Unable to activate account due to placement constraint (incompatible site)"

## Common Causes

1. **Incorrect endpoint configuration** (80% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40332-analysis.md lines 99-103 and 109-111 -->
   - Using global endpoint (realtime.ably.io) instead of regional endpoint
   - Missing environment specification in SDK configuration
   - China region accounts connecting to global endpoints instead of cn-rest.ably.io

2. **Region mismatch** (15% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40332-knowledge.md lines 64-68 -->
   - Account restricted to EU but connecting without EU environment configuration
   - APAC accounts (ap-southeast-*) connecting with global keys
   - Cross-region connection attempts with incompatible placement constraints

3. **Missing custom environment** (5% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40332-analysis.md lines 94-95 -->
   - Not using the custom environment provided for your regional account
   - Using standard API keys instead of region-specific credentials

## Resolution Steps

1. **Identify your account's region**
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40332-analysis.md lines 121-127 -->
   - Check your account documentation for regional restrictions
   - Look for custom environment settings provided when your account was created
   - Common regions include: EU, China (CN), APAC (ap-southeast-*)

2. **Configure the correct endpoint**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40332-knowledge.md lines 102-104 -->
   
   For standard regions, update your SDK configuration:
   ```javascript
   // For EU-restricted accounts
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     key: 'your-api-key',
     environment: 'eu' // Add this line
   });
   
   // For China region
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     key: 'your-api-key',
     restHost: 'cn-rest.ably.io',
     realtimeHost: 'cn-realtime.ably.io'
   });
   ```
   <!-- Code source: Based on documented patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40332-analysis.md lines 99-103, essential for demonstrating regional configuration -->

3. **Use custom environments for enterprise accounts**
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40332-analysis.md line 122 -->
   
   If you were provided a custom environment:
   ```javascript
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     key: 'your-api-key',
     environment: 'acme' // Your custom environment prefix
   });
   // This connects to acme-realtime.ably.io
   ```
   <!-- Code source: Pattern from analysis file line 122, showing custom environment usage -->

4. **Verify your connection**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40332-knowledge.md lines 121-125 -->
   - Test the connection with your regional configuration
   - Ensure all SDK instances use the same regional settings
   - Check that API keys match the regional endpoint

## Automatic Handling

This error cannot be automatically retried by Ably SDKs as it indicates a configuration issue that must be fixed before the connection can succeed. The SDK will not attempt reconnection until you update the configuration.
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40332-analysis.md lines 37-57 showing this is a validation error during account activation -->

## Prevention

- Store regional configuration in environment variables to ensure consistency
- Document your account's regional constraints for your team
- Use the same configuration across all environments (development, staging, production)
- Test connections immediately after receiving regional account credentials
