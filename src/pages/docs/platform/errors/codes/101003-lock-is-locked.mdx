# Error 101003: Lock is locked

## What Happened?
The component lock you requested is currently held by another user, and your request did not take priority.

## Quick Reference
| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 101003 | 400 | Locking/Conflict (Spaces) | Yes - lock will become available |

## Quick Fix
- This is normal behavior when multiple users try to lock the same component
- Subscribe to lock update events to know when the lock becomes available
- Implement retry logic with appropriate backoff

## Error Messages
You'll see this in the lock response:
- "lock is currently locked"

## Common Causes

1. **Concurrent lock attempts** (Most common)
   - Multiple users trying to edit the same component simultaneously
   - Normal behavior in collaborative applications
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/101003-analysis.md lines 41-46 -->

2. **Network timing**
   - Lock requests arriving out of order
   - Presence system delays affecting lock state synchronization
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/101003-knowledge.md lines 93-95 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Handle as expected behavior**
   - This is not an error but normal lock contention
   - Design your UI to gracefully handle locked components
   <!-- Source: FAQ advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/101003-knowledge.md lines 98-99 -->

2. **Subscribe to lock updates**
   - Monitor when the lock becomes available
   - Automatically retry when the lock is released
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/101003-analysis.md lines 79-81 -->

3. **Implement visual feedback**
   - Show who currently holds the lock
   - Display queue position if applicable
   - Notify users when locks become available
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/101003-knowledge.md lines 101-105 -->

## Automatic Handling
The Spaces SDK does not automatically retry lock acquisition. Your application should implement appropriate retry logic based on your use case.
<!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/101003-analysis.md lines 68-70 -->

## Prevention
- Consider using optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Design your collaborative features to minimize lock contention
- Implement clear visual indicators of component availability
