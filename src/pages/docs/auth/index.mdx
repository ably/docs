All interactions between a client and the Ably service must be authenticated.

## Recommended authentication <a id="recommended"/>

| Environment | Recommended Method | Details |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Client-side (browsers, mobile apps) | [Token authentication](/docs/auth/token) | Your server issues tokens ([JWT](/docs/auth/jwt) recommended); clients use `authCallback` to fetch them |
| Server-side (Node.js, Python, etc.) | [Basic authentication](/docs/auth/basic) | Use your API key directly in trusted environments |

<Aside data-type='important'>
**Never use API keys in client-side code.** API keys don't expire. Once compromised, they grant indefinite access. Use [token authentication](/docs/auth/token) with tokens that have narrowly-scoped capabilities, are short-lived, and can be revoked.
</Aside>

See [JWT authentication](/docs/auth/jwt) for server and client setup examples.

An [identified client](/docs/auth/identified-clients) has a verified identity (`clientId`) set by the token issuer.

## Ably API keys <a id="api-keys"/>

Every Ably app can have one or more API keys associated with it. API keys authenticate directly with Ably or are used to issue tokens.

Keys can have different [capabilities](/docs/auth/capabilities), and tokens issued from a key can only request a subset of those capabilities.

### API key format <a id="format"/>

An Ably API key string has the following format: `I2E_JQ.OqUdfg:EVKVTCBlzLBPYJiCZTsIW_pqylJ9WVRB5K9P19Ap1y0`

The API key has three parts:

1. `I2E_JQ` - the public app ID
2. `OqUdfg` - the public key ID (`I2E_JQ.OqUdfg` together form the public API key ID)
3. `EVKVTCBlzLBPYJiCZTsIW_pqylJ9WVRB5K9P19Ap1y0` - the API key secret (never share this)

### Create an API key <a id="create"/>

API keys are created in the [Ably dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard) or programmatically via the [Control API](/docs/platform/account/control-api).

To create an API key in the dashboard:

1. Click the **API Keys** tab in your [dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/app_keys).
2. Click **Create a new API key**.
3. Enter a name to identify the key.
4. Select the [capabilities](/docs/auth/capabilities) to apply.
5. Optionally enable [token revocation](/docs/auth/revocation).
6. Optionally restrict scope to specific channels or queues.

<Aside data-type="note">
Code samples in this documentation use basic authentication for convenience. In production, never use basic authentication client-side as it exposes your API key.
</Aside>

## Selecting an authentication mechanism <a id="selecting-auth"/>

Ably supports two authentication mechanisms:

1. **[Token authentication](/docs/auth/token)**: Short-lived Ably Tokens that expire and can be revoked. Recommended for clients. Use [JWTs](/docs/auth/jwt) for most applications, or native [Ably Tokens](/docs/auth/ably-tokens) when JWTs aren't suitable.
2. **[Basic authentication](/docs/auth/basic)**: Uses your API key directly. Use only on trusted servers.

When deciding which method to use, apply the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege): a client should only possess the credentials and rights it needs. If credentials are compromised, the damage is minimized.

Many applications use a mixed strategy: trusted servers use basic authentication to issue tokens, while browsers and devices use those tokens.

| Scenario | Recommended | Details |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Client-side (browsers, mobile) | JWT | Use [JWT authentication](/docs/auth/jwt). No Ably SDK needed on your server |
| Server-side (trusted environment) | Basic auth | Use your [API key](/docs/auth#api-keys) directly |
| Fine-grained per-user access control | JWT or Ably Token | Set [capabilities](/docs/auth/capabilities) per token |
| Time-limited or revocable access | JWT or Ably Token | Tokens expire and can be [revoked](/docs/auth/revocation) |
| Channel-scoped user claims | JWT only | Embed trusted metadata via [channel-scoped claims](/docs/auth/jwt#channel-claims) |
| Per-connection rate limits | JWT only | Restrict publish rates via [rate limit claims](/docs/auth/jwt#rate-limits) |
| Large capability list or confidential capabilities | Ably Token | JWTs have size limits and can be decoded by clients. Use [Ably Tokens](/docs/auth/ably-tokens) |
| Users must be identified | JWT or Ably Token | Set `clientId` server-side. See [identified clients](/docs/auth/identified-clients) |
