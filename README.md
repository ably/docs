Ably Documentation Overview
===========================

[Ably](https://www.ably.io) is a hugely scalable, superfast and secure hosted realtime messaging service for web-enabled devices.

This Git repository contains most of the [Ably API documentation](https://www.ably.io/documentation) that resides at <https://www.ably.io/documentation> in [Textile](redcloth.org/textile) format.  [Nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) is used to build the static site from the `master` branch.

The Ably documentation was intentionally created as a public repository using a simple text based markup language so that:

* It can be maintained by Ably staff and developers.
* 3rd parties can fork the repository, and submit pull requests to improve the documentation.  We welcome the community's suggestions and input.
* This documentation is later merged upstream to the [Ably primary website documentation](https://www.ably.io/documentation) with each website releas.

Viewing the documentation
------

The static site generated from this documentation repository is hosted at <http://docs.ably.io> and deployed automatically when the `master` branch is updated.  We frequently publish updates from this repository so is typically more up to date than the [official Ably API documentation](https://www.ably.io/documentation).

The official complete Ably documentation that incoporates all the documentation in this repository can be found at <https://www.ably.io/documentation>

Forking and running locally
------

* Fork the repository at https://github.com/ably/docs
* Clone a local version of your forked repo `git clone https://github.com/[you]/docs` and `cd` into it
* Checkout the master branch: `git checkout master`
* Create your feature or fix branch and check it out: `git checkout -b [your-branch]`
* `bundle install` to install the necessary gems
* Create a jsbin config file: `cp config/jsbin_config.example.yaml config/jsbin_config.yaml`

At this point you can either run the repo directly on your machine or via Docker.

If you have Ruby and are comfortable working in a Ruby environment as follows:

* `nanoc compile` to generate the site for the first time
* `nanoc view -p 4000` to start up a web server at <http://localhost:4000>
* `bundle exec guard` to watch for changes and rebuild the site automatically. This is normally run in conjunction with the `.nanoc view -p 4000` command so that you can see changes immediately

If you would prefer to use Docker, then you can set up the env as follows:

* `./docker-run build` to build the initial Docker image
* `./docker-run compile` to compile the HTML for the static site (this is a once off command)
* `./docker-run server` to start up a web server at <http://localhost:4000>
* `./docker-run guard` to watch for changes and rebuild the site automatically. This is normally run in conjunction with the `./docker-run server` command so that you can see changes immediately

Running on Heroku
----

This repo will automatically run on Heroku, but relies on the following buildpacks (see https://github.com/ably-forks/heroku-buildpack-nanoc):

    $ heroku buildpacks
    === ably-docs Buildpack URLs
    1. https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby
    2. https://github.com/ably-forks/heroku-buildpack-nanoc
    3. https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static

Pull requests
----

* Assuming you have followed the steps above, prior to making a PR, make your changes locally and they should be visible within seconds in the browser following a refresh (if using the `guard` command, else a manual `compile` is required).  If the changes are not visible, check your console where `guard` is running for errors.
* Commit your changes, push your branch and send us a pull request
* All pull requests will automatically launch a static review site that will be linked to at the bottom of the PR
