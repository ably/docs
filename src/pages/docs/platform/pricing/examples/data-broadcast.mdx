intro: "This example uses consumption-based pricing for a realtime data broadcast use case, where a single source is publishing frequent updates to many subscribers using Ably Pub/Sub."
---
For this example, we're using a sports betting scenario (odds updates → bettors), but the same pattern applies to any broadcast where only the latest value matters: stock tickers, live scores, auction platforms, transport arrivals, etc.

### Assumptions
- 10,000 monthly active users
- 50 live matches per month
- 200 concurrent viewers per match
- 2-hour match duration
- 60-minute average session duration
- 10 raw odds updates per second from data provider
- Message conflation enabled (500ms interval)

<Aside data-type='note'>
Conflation intervals are configurable from 100ms to 500ms – lower intervals reduce latency; higher intervals reduce message volume and costs.

### Cost summary
The high-level cost breakdown for this scenario. Messages are billed for both inbound (published to Ably) and outbound (delivered to subscribers) – 147.6M messages = 3.6M inbound + 144M outbound.
| Item | Calculation | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Messages (with conflation) | 147.6M × $2.50/M | $370 |
| Connection minutes | 2.4M × $1.00/M | $2.40 |
| Channel minutes | 4.8M × $1.00/M | $4.80 |
| Package fee |  | [See plans](/pricing) |
| **Total** |  | **~$377/month** |

### Connection and channel minutes
How connection and channel minute costs are calculated.

| Metric | Calculation | Monthly | Cost |
|--------|-------------|---------|------|
| Connection minutes | 10K users × 4 sessions × 60 mins | 2.4M | $2.40 |
| Channel minutes | 40K sessions × 60 mins × 2 channels | 4.8M | $4.80 |


### Why conflation, not batching?

For live betting, message conflation is the right optimization because:

- Old odds are semantically stale — batching would group outdated prices together
- Users need the latest price, not a history of price changes
- Conflation reduces both inbound and outbound message costs

Use server-side batching instead when every message matters (e.g., chat, notifications).

<Aside data-type='note'>
Without conflation: 723.6M messages = ~$1,809/month (80% savings).

### Further optimization: Delta compression

For richer payloads (full market depth, live statistics), delta compression can reduce bandwidth costs by sending only the difference between updates.

| Payload type | Full size | With delta | Bandwidth reduction |
|--------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Full market (10+ selections) | 8 KiB | ~2 KiB | 75% |
| Live stats + odds bundle | 15 KiB | ~4 KiB | 73% |
