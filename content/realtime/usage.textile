The Realtime library when initialized attempts to establish and maintain a single connection to the Ably realtime service. The library extends the "REST library":/rest/usage to provide all REST API functionality including the "authentication API":/rest/authentication.   Whereas the REST API is stateless, the Realtime API maintains connection and channel state.

The Ably Realtime client library is available for "most popular languages and platforms":https://ably.io/download/realtime-client-libraries with a consistent API across all platforms. You can view this documentation with your preferred language API and code examples using the language selector navigation above.

blang[javascript].
  The Realtime library for browser Javascript environments should be loaded from the Ably CDN as follows:

  ```[javascript]
  <script lang="text/javascript" src="//cdn.ably.io/lib/ably.min.js" />
  ```

  The script contains both the Realtime and REST libraries as well as all their dependencies. To instance the Realtime library:

  ```[javascript]
  var realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: "{{API_KEY}}" });
  ```

blang[nodejs].
  The Realtime library for nodejs targets clients and servers and is obtainable as a module "directly from npm":https://npmjs.org/package/ably. Install with:

  ```[sh]
  npm install ably-js
  ```

  The Ably Node.js module contains both the REST and Realtime libraries; each is exported separately by the module. To instance the Realtime library:

  ```[nodejs]
  var Ably = require('ably-js');
  var realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: apiKey });
  ```

blang[ruby].
  The Realtime library for Ruby is obtainable as a RubyGem direcly using:

  ```[sh]
  gem install ably
  ```

  If using bundler, simply add the following to your Gemfile and run @bundle install@:

  ```[ruby]
  gem 'ably'
  ```

  The Ably Ruby gem contians both the REST and Realtime libraries; each is namespaced separately by the gem. To instance the Realtime library:

  ```[ruby]
  ably = Ably::Realtime.new(key: api_key)
  ```

blang[java].
  The Realtime library for Java is downloadable as a JAR from "https://github.com/ably/ably-java/releases":https://github.com/ably/ably-java/releases.

  Ensure this JAR is included in your classpath.

  ```[java]
  import io.ably.rest.AblyRealtime;
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime(options);
  ```

The required and supported "options":#options are described below.

h1. Realtime API Reference

h2(#constructor). Constructor

The Ably Realtime library constructor is overloaded allowing it to be instanced using either a string API key or Token ID, or a set of "Realtime Options":#options

bq(definition).
  default: Ably.Realtime(keyOrTokenIdString)
  ruby: Ably::Realtime.new(keyOrTokenIdString)
  java: AblyRealtime(String keyOrTokenIdString)

This will instance the Realtime library with the provided API key or Token ID string.

bq(definition).
  default: AblyRealtime(options)
  ruby: Ably::Realtime.new(options)
  java: AblyRealtime(Options options)

blang[default].
  This will instance the library using the specified "options":#options.

blang[ruby].
  This will instance the library and create a new @Ably::Realtime::Client@ using the specified "options":#options.

The Realtime constructor is used to instance the library.  The Realtime library may be instanced multiple times with the same or different "@options@":#options in any given context. Except where specified otherwise, instances operate independently of one another.


h3(#authentication). Authentication

The Realtime library needs to have credentials to be able to authenticate with the Ably service:

The @key@ option takes a key string, as obtained from the "application dashboard":https://ably.io/dashboard. Use this option if you wish to use Basic authentication, or if you want to be able to request tokens without needing to defer to a separate entity to sign token requests. Note that initialising the library with a @key@ does not necessarily mean that the library will use Basic auth; but knowing the key it is able to create and sign token requests and use token authentication when necessary.

The @token@ option takes a token ID string, and assumes the token has been obtained from some other instance that requested the token. Use the token option if you are provided with a token to use and you do not have a key (or do not have a key with the capabilities that you require).

Since tokens are short-lived, it is rarely sufficient to start with a token without the means for refreshing it. The <span lang="default">@authUrl@ and @authCallback@ options</span><span lang="ruby">@:auth_url@ option and constructor @&token_request_block@</span> are provided to allow a user of the library to provide new tokens or token requests to the library as required; these options even permit the library to be instanced without a @key@ or @token@, and an initial token will be obtained when required.

See "Options":#options for the full set of initialisation options.

h2(#methods).
  default: Realtime Methods
  ruby: Realtime::Client Methods

h6(#close). close

bq(definition).
  default: close()
  ruby: close(&block)
  java: public void close()

This simply calls "connection.close()":/realtime/connection#close and causes the connection to close, entering the @closed@ state. Once closed, the library will not attempt to re-establish the connection without an explicit call to <span lang="default">"@connect()@":/realtime/connection#connect</span><span lang="ruby">"@connect@":/realtime/connection#connect</span>.

h6(#stats). stats

bq(definition).
  default: stats(options, callback)
  ruby:   stats(options Hash) → EventMachine::Deferrable → yields PaginatedResource&lt;Stat&gt;
  java:   public PaginatedResult&lt;Stats&gt; stats(Param[] params)

This call queries the REST "@/stats@":/rest-api#stats API and retrieves application statistics.

h4. Parameters

- params := an optional object containing the query parameters, as specified in the "stats":/rest/stats API documentation.
- <div lang="nodejs,javascript">callback</div> := is a function of the form: @callback(err, stats, relParams)@
where:
<ul>
<li>@err@ contains an error value on the case of an error response as defined in the "REST API":/rest-api#common documentation</li>
<li>on success, @stats@ contains the query result as an array of Stats objects.</li>
<li>where applicable, @relParams@ is a map containing query params for each of the pagination links in the query response (see below).</li>
</ul>

Further details of the supported query params are in the "stats API":/rest/stats documentation.

blang[default].
  h4. Returns

  On success, the returned "PaginatedResult":#paginated-result encapsulates a collection of @Stats@ objects corresponding to the current page of results, and also provides query parameters for any applicable related (e.g. @first@ or @next@ result pages).

  Failure to retrieve the stats will call the callback with the err argument populated.

blang[java].
  h4. Returns

  On success, the returned "PaginatedResult":#paginated-result encapsulates a collection of @Stats@ objects corresponding to the current page of results, and also provides query parameters for any applicable related (e.g. @first@ or @next@ result pages).

  Failure to retrieve the stats will raise an @AblyException@.

blang[ruby].
  h4. Returns

  On success, the returned "PaginatedResult":#paginated-result encapsulates a collection of @Stat@ objects corresponding to the current page of results, and also provides methods to navigate through paged results (e.g. @first@ or @next@).

  Failure to retrieve the history will trigger the errback callback of the Deferrable.

h6(#time). time

bq(definition).
  default: time(callback)
  ruby:   time → EventMachine::Deferrable → yields Time
  java:   public long time

Obtains the time from the Ably service.  This may be required on clients that do not have access to a sufficiently well maintained time source, to provide timestamps for use in token requests.

h2(#members).
  default: Public members
  ruby: Public attributes

The Realtime object exposes the following public <span lang="default">properties</span><span lang="java">fields</span><span lang="ruby">attributes</span>.

h6(#connection). connection

A reference to the "connection":/realtime/connection object for this library instance.

h6(#channels). channels

A reference to the "channels collection":/realtime/channels-messages instance for this library indexed by the channel name. See "channels and messages":/realtime/channels-messages/ for more information.

h2(#options). Options

<div lang="java">
The Ably constructor's @Options@ argument is an instance of @io.ably.types.Options@, constructed either with the default no-argument constructor or with a key string. The following options may be specified.
</div>

<div lang="default">
The Ably constructor's @Options@ argument is an object with one or more of the following properties.
</div>

- appId := The application id. This option is only required if the application id cannot be inferred either from a @key@ or @token@ option. If given, it is the application id as indicated on the "application dashboard":https://ably.io/dashboard.

- key := The full key string, as obtained from the "application dashboard":https://ably.io/dashboard. Use this option if you wish to use Basic authentication, or wish to be able to issue tokens without needing to defer to a separate entity to sign token requests.

- token := A token string, as the value of the @id@ property of a @token_details@ component of a token response.

- authCallback := A <span lang="default">function</span><span lang="java">TokenCallback instance</span> to call when a new token is required.</span>. The role of the callback is to generate a signed @token request@ which may then be submitted by the library to the @requestToken@ API. See "authentication":/rest/authentication for details of the token request format and associated API calls.

- authUrl := A URL that the library may use to obtain a signed token request. For example, this can be used by a client to obtain signed token requests from an application server.

- authHeaders := A set of headers to be added to any request made to the @authUrl@.  Useful when an application requires these to be added to validate the request or implement the response.

- authParams := A set of @POST@ params to be added to any request made to the @authUrl@.  Useful when an application require these to be added to validate the request or implement the response.

- tls := _true_ A boolean value, indicating whether or not a TLS ("SSL") secure connection should be used.

- clientId := A client id, used for identifying this client for presence purposes. The clientId can be any string. This option is primarily intended to be used in situations where the library is instanced with a key; note that a clientId may also be implicit in a token used to instance the library; an error will be raised if a clientId specified here conflicts with the clientId implicit in the token.

- <div lang="javascript,nodejs,ruby">log</div> := Parameters to control the log output of the library. The supplied value must be an object that may contain one or both of the following entries:
<ul><li>@level@: a number controlling the verbosity of the output from 1 (minimum, errors only) to 4 (most verbose);</li>
<li>@handler@: a function to handle each line of log output. If @handler@ is not specified, @console.log@ is used.</li></ul>
Note that the log level and log handler have global scope in the library and will thus not act independently between library instances when multiple library instances are existing concurrently.

- <div lang="java">logLevel</div> := An int controlling the verbosity of the output from 1 (minimum, errors only) to 4 (most verbose). Note that the @logLevel@ is a static variable in the library and will thus not act independently between library instances when multiple library instances are existing concurrently.

- <div lang="java">logHandler</div> := A @PrintStream@ to handle each line of log output. If @logHandler@ is not specified, @System.out@ is used. Note that the @logHandler@ is a static variable in the library and will thus not act independently between library instances when multiple library instances are existing concurrently.

- <div lang="javascript,nodejs">transports</div> := In those environments supporting multiple transports, an array of transports to use, in descending order of preference. <span lang="javascript">In the browser environment the available transports are:
@web_socket@, @xhr@, @jsonp@.</span>

- useTextProtocol := _false_ The browser client library detects whether or not the browser has the capability to use the binary protocol, and enables this option if the browser requires the use of the text protocol.

- queueMessages := _true_ If false, this disables the default behaviour whereby the library queues messages on a connection in the disconnected or connecting states. The default behaviour allows applications to submit messages immediately upon instancing the library, without having to wait for the connection to be established. Applications may use this option to disable that behaviour if they wish to have application-level control over the queueing under those conditions.

- echoMessages := _true_ If false, prevents messages originating from this connection being echoed back on the same connection.

- recover := This option allows a connection to inherit the state of a previous connection that may have existed under an different instance of the Realtime library. This might typically be used by clients of the browser library to ensure connection state can be preserved when the user refreshes the page. See connection_state_recovery for further information on this option.

<div lang="java">
h2(#paginated-result). PaginatedResult

A @PaginatedResult@ is an interface that represents the result of a query that supports pagination. An instance of @PaginatedResult@ encapsulates a collection of @Stats@ objects representing the current page of results, and provides the means - in the form of @Param[]@ to perform queries for subsequent or related pages.

- public Stats[] asArray() := Returns the current page of results as an Array.
- public List&lt;Stats&gt; := Returns the current page of results as a List.
- public Param[] getFirst() := Returns the params to pass to a @stats()@ call to reproduce the first call in this paginated sequence.
- public Param[] getCurrent() := Returns the params to pass to a @stats()@ call to reproduce the current call in this paginated sequence.
- public Param[] getNext() := Returns the params to pass to a @stats()@ call to reproduce the next call in this paginated sequence.

</div>
