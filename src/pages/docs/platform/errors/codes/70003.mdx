This error occurs when Ably Integrations (formerly Reactor) cannot process more requests due to reaching the maximum number of pending operations, typically when downstream services cannot keep up with the incoming message rate.

| Error code | HTTP status code | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 70003 | 400 | Integration error | Yes |

## Error messages

| Message | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Maximum number of pending requests exceeded | The integration service has reached its concurrent request limit for Kafka or other downstream services. |

## Impact

This error indicates that integration delivery is being temporarily throttled:

- Messages continue to be published to Ably channels normally.
- Integration delivery (webhooks, Kafka, BigQuery) may be delayed.
- The error is temporary and typically resolves when the downstream service catches up.
- Other integrations and channels continue to operate normally.

The Ably platform will automatically retry integration delivery when capacity becomes available. This is a protective mechanism to prevent overwhelming downstream services and maintain system stability.

## Quick fixes

Try these immediate solutions:

- Reduce the rate of messages being published that trigger integrations.
- Check the status of your downstream services (Kafka, BigQuery, webhook endpoints).
- Review your integration rules to ensure they're not triggering on every message unnecessarily.
- Consider implementing batching where possible to reduce the number of individual integration triggers.

## Troubleshooting

### High-volume integration events

| Error messages |
| -------------- |
| Maximum number of pending requests exceeded |

This occurs when:

- Your application generates a burst of messages that all trigger integration rules.
- Multiple integration rules are configured for the same channel patterns.
- A downstream service (like BigQuery or Kafka) temporarily cannot keep up with writes.

To resolve this:

- Implement rate limiting in your application before publishing to Ably.
- Use more specific channel patterns in integration rules to reduce unnecessary triggers.
- Monitor your downstream service capacity and scale as needed.
- Consider using message batching in your application logic.

### Downstream service capacity issues

Based on real-world incidents, this error often indicates that the receiving service cannot process messages quickly enough. For example, BigQuery write limits or Kafka cluster capacity issues can cause this error.

{/* Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/70003-knowledge.md lines 69-77 */}

To resolve this:

- Check your downstream service metrics and logs for capacity issues.
- Increase the processing capacity of your integration endpoints.
- Ensure webhook endpoints respond quickly (under 5 seconds).
- Consider implementing queue-based processing on your integration endpoints.

## Prevention

To prevent this error from occurring:

- **Design for scale**: Plan your integration architecture to handle peak loads, not just average traffic.
- **Use specific filters**: Make integration rules as specific as possible to avoid unnecessary processing.
- **Monitor continuously**: Set up monitoring for both Ably message rates and downstream service capacity.
- **Implement gradual rollouts**: When launching new features, gradually increase traffic to identify capacity limits.
- **Optimize endpoint performance**: Ensure webhook handlers process requests quickly and return responses promptly.
