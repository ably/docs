Ably can deliver native push notifications to devices using, amongst others, "Apple's Push Notification":https://developer.apple.com/notifications/ service and Google's "Firebase Cloud Messaging":https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ service. Native push notifications, unlike Ably's "channel based pub/sub messaging":/realtime/channels, do not require the device to maintain a connection to Ably, as the underlying platform or OS is responsible for maintaining its own battery-efficient transport to receive push notifications. Therefore, native push notifications are commonly used to display visual notifications to users or launch a background process for an app in a battery-efficient manner.

h2(#deliver). Delivering push notifications

Ably provides two models for delivering push notifications to devices:

h3(#channel-broadcasting). Channel-based broadcasting

The model for delivering push notifications to devices over channels is intentionally very similar to how messages are normally delivered using Ably's "pub/sub channel":/core-features/channels. For example, a normal message published on an Ably channel is broadcast immediately to all realtime subscribers of that channel. When broadcasting push notifications on channels, however, the process is the same with the exception that the subscribers (devices receiving push notifications) are registered in advance using our API and the message itself must contain an *extra push notification payload* that specifies the optional visual format and optional data payload of the native push notification.

h3(#direct-publishing). Direct publishing

Ably provides a REST API that allows native push notifications to be delivered directly to:

* Devices identified by their unique device ID
* Devices identified by their assigned "@clientId@":/realtime/authentication#identified-clients
* Devices identified by the recipient details of the native push transport such as their unique @registrationToken@ in the case of FCM, @deviceToken@ in the case of APNS, or @targetUrl@ and @encryptionKey@ in the case of a Web device. This means is particularly useful when migrating to Ably with existing push notification target devices.

h2(#activate). Activating a device and receiving notifications

<%= partial partial_version('general/push/_activate_subscribe_intro') %>

"Find out more about device activations and subscriptions":/general/push/activate-subscribe.

h2(#admin). Managing devices and subscriptions

Whilst the realtime client libraries provide APIs for a device to activate itself (via "@client.push@":/general/push/activate-subscribe) and subscribe for push notifications (via "@channel.push@":/general/push/activate-subscribe), those APIs are intentionally limited to actions pertaining to the device it is run on.

A separate and distinct push admin API is additionally provided in our client libraries specifically designed for use by your servers to facilitate managing and delivering push notifications across all of your registered devices. This API, amongst other things, includes features to manage registered devices, channel subscriptions and deliver push notifications directly.

"Find out more about the push admin API":/general/push/admin.

h2(#platform-support). Platform support

Ably currently offers support for push notifications on the following platforms:

- "Apple Push Notifications":https://developer.apple.com/notifications/ := supported on all mobile devices running iOS and desktop devices running OS X
- "Firebase Cloud Messaging":https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ := supported on all Android and iOS devices, although we use FCM exclusively for Android message delivery
- Experimental "W3C Push API":https://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/ := experimental support for "modern W3C compliant browsers":https://caniuse.com/#feat=push-api (this does not include Apple's Safari browser). "Get in touch":https://www.ably.io/contact if you want to use this.

We no longer support "Google Cloud Messaging":https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/; this is deprecated by Google, in favour of FCM, and the service will soon be terminated altogether.

h3(#download). Downloading a client library with push support

The following Ably client library SDKs provide support for activation and receiving of native push notifications:

* "Android SDK":https://github.com/ably/ably-java
* "iOS Objective-C and Swift SDK":https://github.com/ably/ably-ios
* Experimental "W3C Push API":https://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/ compatible browser push notification support in the "Javascript SDK":https://github.com/ably/ably-js. "Get in touch":https://www.ably.io/contact for access to this experimental feature

All Ably client library SDKs, that adhere to the "v1.1 specification support":/client-lib-development-guide/features/, support "push publishing":/general/push/publish and "push admin":/general/push/admin functionality.

"See the list of client libraries available for download":https://www.ably.io/download

h3(#features). Key features

* General Availability Support for Android and iOS
* Experimental support for Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Apple's Safari Notifications planned.
* Custom notification formats and badges for iOS and Android. Browsers receive the notification in a Web Worker which is in turn responsible for presenting a visual notification to the user.
* Both visual notifications and data payloads can be sent to mobile devices.
* Any number of mobile and browser devices can be registered on pub/sub channels. Each time a message is published with a push notification payload, Ably will ensure that all registered devices receive the push notification in near realtime.
* Scale to millions of devices simultaneously by leveraging Ably's global platform.
* User-centric device registration allowing devices to be grouped by user ("@clientId@":/realtime/authentication#identified-clients)
* Filters can be applied to notifications such as client ID, connection ID or device type, or alternatively you can push message directly to devices or users via our API.
* Realtime metrics for your delivered and undelivered push notifications.

h2(#smart-notifications). Smart Notifications (coming soon)

Ably's Smart Notifications offers a less intrusive and more effective way to notify your users with native iOS, Android and browser notifications. Instead of delivering "dumb" push notifications to your users when you wish to get their attention, Ably allows you to deliver messages based on a user's connection state, their active device and their current context within your application. This means you can send less but more effective notifications to your users. "Find out more":https://blog.ably.io/smart-notifications-the-next-evolution-of-messaging-6dcb24bf857.

h3(#how-it-works). How do Smart Notifications work?

Each Ably "pub/sub channel":/core-features/channels can have one or more devices registered to it, and every device registered can be assigned a client identifier (i.e. they are an "identified client in the Ably system":/realtime/authentication/#identified-clients).

When a message is published on a "pub/sub channel":/core-features/channels, a smart notification payload and rules can optionally be included with the message. When the Ably service receives a message with a smart notification payload, it will do one of two things:

* If the notification is configured as a "dumb" push notification, it will deliver the push notification to the relevant devices associated with the pub/sub channel. This is a common pattern with other vendors and it assumes that if the registered device app is not active, a visual push notification will be displayed, and if the app is open and active, the visual push notification will be suppressed. In the case of a data push notification, it will be always be delivered and no visual indicator is shown to the user.
* If the notification is configured as a "smart" push notification, then Ably will process the rules for each smart notification in a user-centric way, such that the user is notified in the most effective way on the most relevant device based on their current context. For example, if a user has your mobile app installed but also uses your web app during office hours, and a  notification is sent whilst the user is currently using the web app, then a visual notification can be shown only on the open web app, and the unnecessary duplicate push notification to their device can be suppressed. If however, after some configured time, the user has not responded to the message in the web app, a follow up native mobile push notification could be triggered automatically by Ably.
