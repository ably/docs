      Pub/Sub Channels is Ably’s cloud-based pub/sub (publish/subscribe) platform-as-a-service (PaaS) product. It provides a set of consistent and idiomatic APIs across a variety of platforms for building realtime capabilities in applications including live data broadcast, push notifications, stream processing, and chat. With Channels, developers can build applications that communicate in realtime without needing to manage things such as scaling, latency, data integrity and network outages.
