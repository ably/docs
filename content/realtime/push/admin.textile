The client libraries provide a Push Admin API that is intended to be used on a customer's servers to perform all the management tasks relating to registering devices, managing push device subscriptions and delivering push notifications directly to devices or devices associated with a client identifier.

The push admin API is accessible via the @push@ attribute of the realtime client. For example to publish a push notification directly to a device, you would access the publish method as follows:

```[jsall]
var realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: apiKey });
realtime.push.admin.publish(recipient, data, function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Unable to publish push notification; err = ' + err.message);
    return;
  }
  console.log('Push notification published');
});
```
```[ruby]
realtime = Ably::Realtime.new(key: api_key);
result = realtime.push.admin.publish(recipient, data) do
  puts 'Push notification published'
end
result.errback do |err|
  puts "Unable to publish push notification; err = #{err}"
end
```

p(tip). The push notification service is currently in beta. Before you get started, please take a look at the "push service beta notice":/realtime/push#beta.

The push admin API offers three key features:

* "@publish@":#publish for "direct publishing to devices and groups of identified devices":/realtime/push/publish#direct-publishing
* "@deviceRegistrations@":#device-registrations for registering, updating, listing and deregistering push devices
* "@channelSubscriptions@":#channel-subscriptions for subscribing, listing and unsubscribing individual devices or groups of identified devices to push notifications published on channels
