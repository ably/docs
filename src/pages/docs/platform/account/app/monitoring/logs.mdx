The Logs section in your Ably dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities through detailed historical event logging across all aspects of your application. Access your application logs in the [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/logs) under the Logs section. These are historical logs with a short delay, not live logs. This interface enables you to track system activities, troubleshoot issues, and analyze patterns across API requests, channels, connections, integrations, and push notifications.
