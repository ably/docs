h2(#developer-console). Developer console

The "Ably dashboard":https://ably.com/dashboard contains a developer console. In the developer console you can view connection events. The following screenshot illustrates an example connection:

</a>

You can attach to a specific channel to view messages. You can also publish messages directly in the console:

  <img src="/images/screenshots/developer-console-channels.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Developer Console - Channels">
</a>

The developer console provides you with some REST API Curl command snippets that can help you test out Ably quickly:

</a>

Note, for convenience, the Curl commands have your Ably credentials already added.

h2(#react-hooks). React hooks

Use Ably in your React application using idiomatic React Hooks.

Using this package you can:

* Interact with Ably channels using a React hook.
* Send messages via Ably using the channel instances the hooks provide.
* Get notifications of user presence on channels.
* Send presence updates.

The hooks provide a simplified syntax for interacting with Ably. The hooks also manage the lifecycle of the Ably SDK instances for you, subscribing and unsubscribing to channels and events when your React components re-render.
