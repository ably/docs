Pricing for realtime platforms should be flexible and scalable. Rigid pricing tiers with fixed quotas on messages and concurrent connections often result in huge price jumps when you hit arbitary limits. It can even impact on your service availablity if the realtime provider locks you out once you hit your limits. This can be a huge pain when you're trying to grow your business or have a service with unpredictable spikes. And it often works against you when you want to scale up capacity because the price changes are so dramatic. Not good.
