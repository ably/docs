Your connection cannot be resumed because you're now connecting to a different Ably site (data center) than where your original connection was established.

| Error code | HTTP status code | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 80023 | 400 | Connection/Resume Error | Yes (with new connection) |

## Impact

This error prevents resuming your previous connection state, which means:

- Channel message continuity cannot be maintained across the disconnection
- Messages sent while disconnected need to be retrieved using the history API
- The SDK will establish a fresh connection at the new optimal site
- Presence state will be re-established on the new connection

The error is automatically handled by Ably SDKs, which will establish a new connection to the current optimal site. While this means you cannot resume the exact connection state, normal operations will continue after the new connection is established.

## Troubleshooting

### Geographic movement or network changes

This occurs when:
- You or your users physically move between geographic regions
- Your network provider changes routing to reach Ably through a different path
- VPN connections route you through different geographic locations
- Corporate network policies change your apparent location

To resolve this:
- Allow the SDK to establish a fresh connection at the new site
- The SDK handles this automatically - no manual intervention needed
- Use channel history to retrieve any messages sent during disconnection

### Fallback host connection

This occurs when:
- Your primary endpoint becomes unreachable
- The SDK connects to a fallback host in a different site
- Network issues force routing through alternative data centers

To resolve this:
- Let the SDK complete the fallback connection process
- Monitor for persistent connectivity issues if this happens frequently
- Check network connectivity to primary Ably endpoints

### Connection state recovery limitations

When error 80023 occurs, connection state recovery within the 2-minute window is not possible across sites. This is by design to maintain:
- Message ordering guarantees
- Presence state consistency
- Channel continuity

To handle this:
- Retrieve missed messages using the channel history API after reconnection
- Re-establish presence state if using presence features
- Accept that cross-site resumes trade continuity for optimal routing

## Prevention

While you cannot prevent all occurrences of this error (as it's often due to factors outside your control), you can minimize its impact:

- Design your application to handle connection interruptions gracefully
- Use channel history to catch up on missed messages after reconnection
- Implement client-side state management that doesn't rely solely on connection state
- Test your application's behavior when connections are re-established at different sites
