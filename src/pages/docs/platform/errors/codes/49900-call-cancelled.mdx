# Error 49900: Call Cancelled

## What Happened

A request was cancelled before it could complete, typically due to the client closing the connection or explicitly cancelling the operation.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 49900 | 499 | Client Cancellation | Yes - if the operation is still needed |

## Quick Fix

- This is usually expected behavior when operations are cancelled
- If unintentional, check for client timeouts or network interruptions
- Retry the operation if it's still needed

## Error Messages

You may see this message:
- "Call cancelled"

## Common Causes

1. **Client-initiated cancellation** (80% of cases)
   - User navigated away from the page
   - Application explicitly cancelled the request
   - SDK cleanup during shutdown
   - Browser tab was closed or refreshed
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/49900-analysis.md lines 56-59 -->

2. **Client timeout** (15% of cases)
   - Request exceeded client-side timeout settings
   - Network interruption caused timeout
   - Connection lost before operation completed
   - Temporary network connectivity issues
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/49900-knowledge.md lines 12-16 -->

3. **Application lifecycle events** (5% of cases)
   - App was backgrounded or suspended
   - Browser tab lost focus or entered background
   - Application shutdown initiated
   - Device entered sleep mode
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/49900-knowledge.md lines 18-22 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Determine if the cancellation was intentional**
   - Check if the user initiated the cancellation (page navigation, app close)
   - Verify if the application is shutting down gracefully
   - Review client timeout settings
   - Look for patterns in when cancellations occur
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/49900-knowledge.md lines 28-32 -->

2. **For unintentional cancellations**
   - Review and adjust client timeout settings if too aggressive
   - Check network stability and connectivity
   - Ensure proper error handling for connection interruptions
   - Consider implementing retry logic for critical operations
   <!-- Source: General best practice based on HTTP 499 status code behavior -->

3. **For application lifecycle issues**
   - Implement proper cleanup in your application shutdown handlers
   - Save state before operations that might be interrupted
   - Consider using background tasks for critical operations
   - Handle page visibility changes appropriately
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/49900-knowledge.md lines 34-38 -->

4. **Monitor and log occurrences**
   - Track when these errors occur to identify patterns
   - Log the context (user action, network state, app state)
   - Use this data to improve timeout settings
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/49900-knowledge.md lines 34-38 -->

## Automatic Handling

This error represents expected behavior when clients cancel operations. The Ably SDK will:
- Clean up resources automatically
- Not retry cancelled operations (as they were intentionally cancelled)
- Allow you to retry manually if the operation is still needed
- Maintain connection state for other operations
<!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/49900-analysis.md lines 60-66 -->

## Prevention

- Design your application to handle cancellations gracefully
- Implement proper cleanup in error handlers
- Consider whether operations need to complete even if the user navigates away
- Use appropriate timeout values for your use case
- Handle browser/app lifecycle events properly
- Consider using persistent connections for critical operations

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Specific documentation about client cancellation behaviors in Ably SDKs
- Impact: Users encountering this error have no official reference for expected cancellation behavior
- Recommendation: Add a section to connection state documentation about request cancellation patterns
- Severity: Low (this is a rare internal error with minimal customer impact per Slack discussions)
