- webhookId := an internal unique ID for the configured webhook
- source := the source for the webhook, namely "@channel.message@", "@channel.presence@", "@channel.lifecycle@"
- timestamp := a timestamp represented as milliseconds since the epoch for the presence event
- data := an object containing the data of the event defined below in "JSONPath format":http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath
