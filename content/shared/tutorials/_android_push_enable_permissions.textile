Next, you'll need to ensure your Ably app is correctly set up to use Push Notifications. Firstly, make sure the API key you're using has both the @Push Admin@ and @Push Subscribe@ permissions, as seen below. If not, select the *Settings* option on the API key interface and tick the permissions so they're available.

These permissions correspond to the following:

* "@push-subscribe@":/general/push/activate-subscribe: A client with this permission is a push target device, and it can manage registration and subscription to Push Notifications for itself. However, it won't be able to manage push registrations or channel subscriptions for any other device.
* "@push-admin@":/general/push/admin: A client with this permission has full access to the "Push Admin API":https://www.ably.io/documentation/general/push/admin and can manage registrations and subscriptions for all devices.

The @push-subscribe@ permission will be important for the Android app we'll be making, such that it can subscribe to Push Notifications. @push-admin@ is what will allow us to publish Push Notifications, and would be useful if we wanted to create a server which controlled our push devices.

Read more about permissions (also called capabilities) in our "API documentation":/core-features/authentication#capabilities-explained.

Next, navigate to the Ably app's *Settings* tab, go down to the *Channel rules* section and add a new channel rule for a namespace by checking the *Push notifications enabled* option. In this tutorial, we'll be eventually publishing some Push Notifications via the @push:test_push_channel@ channel, so we'll use the "channel namespace":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030058 @push@, as seen below.

With this done, your app now has a key with push permissions, along with a channel on which push notifications can be sent.
