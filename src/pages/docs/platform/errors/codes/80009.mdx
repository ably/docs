Your connection to Ably exists in configuration but lacks an active transport handle to carry data, preventing any actual communication.

| Error code | HTTP status code | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 80009 | 500 | Connection Error | No |

## Impact

This error prevents all connection operations:
- No messages can be sent or received
- Authentication callbacks cannot complete
- Connection appears established but is non-functional
- Requires establishing a completely new connection

The connection cannot be repaired and must be recreated from scratch.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication callback or URL failures

{/* Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/80009-analysis.md lines 16-29 */}
This occurs when:
- Your authentication callback throws an exception during token request
- Your authentication URL endpoint fails or times out
- The auth operation exceeds the configured timeout period

To resolve this:
- Verify your auth callback completes within the timeout period
- Check that your auth URL endpoint is responsive and returns valid tokens
- Ensure your authentication endpoint returns proper JSON token responses
- Create a fresh connection after fixing the authentication issue

### Transport initialization failures

{/* Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/80009-knowledge.md lines 11-19 */}
This occurs when:
- The network transport never properly initialized during connection setup
- System resource constraints prevent transport creation
- Platform-specific network restrictions interfere with transport establishment

To resolve this:
- Close the current connection completely
- Wait a moment for proper cleanup
- Establish a fresh connection
- Monitor device memory and network resources

### Historical Comet transport issues (JavaScript SDK)

{/* Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/80009-knowledge.md lines 91-103 */}
In older versions of the JavaScript SDK, this occurred with Comet transport on Chrome/Windows:
- Error appeared after receiving a connected callback
- Failed during channel subscribe or presence enter operations

To resolve this (if using older SDK versions):
- Force WebSocket transport by adding `transports: ['web_socket']` to initialization options
- Update to the latest SDK version where this issue has been resolved

## Prevention

{/* Source: Best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/80009-knowledge.md lines 49-64 */}
To prevent this error:
- Always close connections properly before creating new ones
- Don't attempt to reuse connection objects that have failed
- Monitor app memory usage and release unused resources promptly
- Implement proper connection lifecycle management
- For auth callbacks, ensure they complete quickly and handle errors gracefully
