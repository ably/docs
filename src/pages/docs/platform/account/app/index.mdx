Manage and monitor your applications on the Ably platform using the Ably dashboard. Create new apps, view existing ones, and configure settings from your browser.

Begin by [logging](https://ably.com/login) in to Ably through your browser. Once you're logged in, you have access to the Ably [dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts), where you can [create a new app](#create) or [view your existing apps.](#view)

## Create a new app <a id="create"/>

The following image displays the Ably dashboard when no apps have been created yet. To get started, you can easily **Create new app**:

![Create apps in the Ably dashboard](../../../../../images/content/screenshots/dash/create-app.png)

## View your apps <a id="view"/>

If you have created apps already, your dashboard will look similar to the one shown in the following image. Each app displayed is a link to its specific dashboard, where you can view and configure settings, as well as monitor usage and statistics:

![Your apps in the Ably dashboard](../../../../../images/content/screenshots/dash/your-apps.png)

### Environments <a id="environment"/>

Each Ably app acts as a sandboxed environment, isolated from other apps in your account. This makes it straightforward to set up separate environments for development, staging, and production by creating dedicated apps for each.

For example, if you're building a product called "chat-app", you could create:

- `chat-app-production` for your live production environment
- `chat-app-staging` for pre-production testing
- `chat-app-development` for ongoing development work

This approach provides complete isolation between environments, ensuring that development activities don't interfere with production traffic. An alternative approach for complete resource isolation, consider using separate Ably accounts for development and production environments. This ensures development activities cannot impact production resources under any circumstances.

<Aside data-type='important'>
Account limits are shared. While apps are sandboxed from each other, they share the same [account limits](/docs/platform/pricing/limits) such as connection counts and channel limits. A development app experiencing high usage could potentially impact your production app if account limits are reached.
