The Database Connector exposes an HTTP server that can be used to monitor instance health and metrics.

The server listens on the port defined by the @ADBC_HEALTH_ADDRESS@ config and defaults to port 2259.

h3(#connector-health). Health

The Database Connector exposes an HTTP endpoint on /health that returns a JSON containing the status of:

* Connectivity to the Ably service
* Connectivity to the PostgreSQL database
* Access to the nodes table, determined by executing SELECT 1 FROM nodes
* Access to the outbox table, determined by executing SELECT 1 FROM outbox

Internally, the connector periodically refreshes the health status for each target according to the interval defined by the @ADBC_HEALTH_REFRESH_INTERVAL@ configuration option.

An example healthy response from the endpoint is:

```
curl localhost:2259/health
{
   "ably":{
      "status":"up"
   },
   "nodes_table":{
      "status":"up"
   },
   "outbox_table":{
      "status":"up"
   },
   "postgres":{
      "status":"up"
   }
}
```

h3(#connector-metrics). Health

The Database Connector exposes an HTTP endpoint on /metrics that implements a "Prometheus":https://prometheus.io/-compatible metrics endpoint that can be used to monitor the following metrics:

|_. Metric |_. Type |_. Description |
| ably_pending_acks | "gauge:https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge" | Number of pending messages waiting to be acknowledged by Ably. |
| nodes_table_entries | "gauge":https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge | Number of entries in the nodes table. |
| nodes_table_errors | "counter":https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter | Number of errors querying the nodes table. |
| outbox_table_entries | "gauge":https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge | Number of entries in the outbox table. |
| outbox_table_errors | "counter":https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter | Number of errors querying the outbox table. |
| promhttp_metric_handler_errors_total | "counter":https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter | Total number of internal errors encountered by the promhttp metric handler. |

Example response from the endpoint:

```
curl localhost:2259/metrics
# HELP ably_pending_acks Number of pending messages waiting to be acknowledged by Ably
# TYPE ably_pending_acks gauge
ably_pending_acks 0
# HELP nodes_table_entries Number of entries in the nodes table
# TYPE nodes_table_entries gauge
nodes_table_entries 1
# HELP nodes_table_errors Number of errors querying the nodes table
# TYPE nodes_table_errors counter
nodes_table_errors 0
# HELP outbox_table_entries Number of entries in the outbox table
# TYPE outbox_table_entries gauge
outbox_table_entries 1
# HELP outbox_table_errors Number of errors querying the outbox table
# TYPE outbox_table_errors counter
outbox_table_errors 0
# HELP promhttp_metric_handler_errors_total Total number of internal errors encountered by the promhttp metric handler.
# TYPE promhttp_metric_handler_errors_total counter
promhttp_metric_handler_errors_total{cause="encoding"} 0
promhttp_metric_handler_errors_total{cause="gathering"} 0
