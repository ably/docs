The web client provides a browser-based interface for testing and debugging your realtime application. Access the web client through your [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/console) under the Console section. It offers realtime insights into application-wide events, such as connection status changes and channel activity. These features enable you to:

* Observe changes in connection status across the application.
* View activity on specific channels, including message traffic and channel events.
* Examine event logs to troubleshoot your application.

## Application-wide events interface <a id="application-events"/>

The application-wide events interface allows you to monitor your application's health and activity in realtime.

The following explains the realtime monitoring tools in the application-wide events interface:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| API key | The API key to access and view events within the app. |
| Average application-wide events per second (p/s) | This metric shows the average number of events occurring per second across your application. For example, if the current rate is 0, no active events are being processed. |
| Event log table | The event log table displays a record of events related to the current client's connection status. This table can be used to debug potential issues in your application. |

## Message auditing and logging <a id="message-auditing"/>

The web client displays messages in realtime for debugging and testing purposes, but does not provide persistent message auditing or logging capabilities. Ably does not currently offer native functionality to view historical messages filtered by specific channels or client IDs for auditing purposes.

If you need to audit or log messages by channel or client ID, implement this functionality on the application side. Consider using:

- [Webhooks](/docs/platform/integrations/webhooks) to send message events to your logging system
- [Message queues](/docs/platform/integrations/queues) to process and store message data
- Client-side logging in your application code

For native message auditing features, [contact support](mailto:support@ably.com) to discuss requirements.
