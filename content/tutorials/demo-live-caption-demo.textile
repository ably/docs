title: Live Captioning with Ably and Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services
meta_description: This is a web app that uses Azure Cognitive Service (ACS) and Ably. It is designed to be run in a browser on your mobile phone while you're wearing mask with a flexible LED display. It uses ACS to perform streaming transcription of your microphone input. The data returned from ACS is then sent to the display on the mask via Ably’s MQTT broker. The transcription is also displayed in the browser.
