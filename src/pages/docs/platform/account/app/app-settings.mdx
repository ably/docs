| Description | Optional description of the application's purpose |
| Status | Enable or disable the entire application |

### Application status

Control application availability:

| Status | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Enabled | Application accepts connections and processes messages |
| Disabled | All connections rejected, no message processing |

When disabling an application:
- Existing connections are immediately terminated
- New connection attempts are rejected
- Message publishing and subscription stop working
- API operations return authentication errors

## Security settings

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

Configure encryption requirements:

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| TLS required | Force all connections to use encrypted transport |
| TLS optional | Allow both encrypted and unencrypted connections |

Recommendation: Always require TLS for production applications to protect data in transit.

### Authentication requirements

Set authentication policies:

| Policy | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| API key required | All connections must provide valid API key |
| Token authentication | Require JWT tokens for client authentication |
| Anonymous access | Allow unauthenticated connections (not recommended) |

### Access control

Configure client access restrictions:

- Client ID requirements - Force clients to identify themselves
- Capability restrictions - Limit what operations clients can perform
- IP address filtering - Restrict access to specific IP ranges
- Geographic restrictions - Limit access by country or region

## Channel configuration

### Default channel settings

Configure default behavior for all channels:

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Message persistence | How long to store messages by default |
| Presence events | Enable presence functionality by default |
| Message history | Allow message history retrieval |
| Push notifications | Enable push notification capabilities |

### Channel rules

Create specific rules for channels or channel namespaces:

#### Creating channel rules

1. Click Add new rule in the channel rules section
2. Configure rule parameters:
   - Channel pattern - Which channels this rule applies to
   - Rule settings - Specific behavior for matching channels
   - Priority - Order of rule evaluation

#### Channel rule settings

| Setting | Description | Options |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Channel filter | Pattern to match channel names | Exact name or regex pattern |
| Persist messages | Message storage duration | None, 2 minutes, 24 hours, 72 hours |
| Persist last message | Keep last message for 365 days | Enabled/disabled |
| Identified clients only | Require client ID for access | Enabled/disabled |
| TLS only | Force encrypted connections | Enabled/disabled |
| Push notifications | Enable push capabilities | Enabled/disabled |
| Message interactions | Enable message threading/reactions | Enabled/disabled |
| Server-side batching | Batch messages for efficiency | Enabled/disabled |

#### Rule examples

Common channel rule patterns:

<Code>
```
// Private channels require identification
Pattern: private:*
Settings: Identified clients only = true, TLS only = true

// Admin channels with extended persistence  
Pattern: admin:*
Settings: Persist messages = 72 hours, Identified clients only = true

// Public channels with basic persistence
Pattern: public:*
Settings: Persist messages = 2 minutes, Push notifications = true
```
</Code>

### Message persistence

Configure how long messages are stored:

| Duration | Use Case |
| -------- | -------- |
| None | Real-time only, no history needed |
| 2 minutes | Basic connection recovery |
| 24 hours | Short-term message replay |
| 72 hours | Extended message history |
| 365 days (last message) | Maintaining channel state |

## Protocol support

### Supported protocols

Enable compatibility with different messaging protocols:

| Protocol | Description | Use Case |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Ably native | Full-featured Ably protocol | Best performance and features |
| Pusher | Pusher protocol compatibility | Migrate from Pusher |
| PubNub | PubNub protocol compatibility | Migrate from PubNub |
| MQTT | MQTT protocol support | IoT and embedded devices |

### Protocol configuration

For each enabled protocol:

- Authentication mapping - How API keys map to protocol auth
- Feature limitations - Which features are available
- Message format - How messages are formatted
- Connection parameters - Protocol-specific settings

### Migration considerations

When enabling protocol compatibility:

- Test thoroughly - Verify protocol behavior matches expectations
- Feature parity - Some Ably features may not be available
- Performance - Native protocol typically performs better
- Security - Ensure security requirements are met

## Application limits

### Configuring limits

Set application-specific limits:

| Limit Type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Connection limit | Maximum concurrent connections |
| Message rate limit | Messages per second/minute/hour |
| Channel limit | Maximum concurrent channels |
| Presence limit | Maximum presence members per channel |

### Rate limiting

Configure rate limiting policies:

- Per-connection limits - Limits applied to individual connections
- Per-channel limits - Limits applied to specific channels
- Global limits - Limits applied across the entire application
- Burst allowances - Temporary exceeding of normal limits

### Limit enforcement

When limits are exceeded:

- Connection throttling - Slow down new connections
- Message queuing - Queue excess messages for later delivery
- Rejection - Reject excess requests with error responses
- Client notification - Inform clients of rate limiting

## Webhook configuration

### Webhook rules

Configure webhooks to send events to external services:

| Event Type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Channel lifecycle | Channel attach/detach events |
| Message events | Published messages |
| Presence events | Presence enter/leave/update |
| Connection events | Client connect/disconnect |

### Webhook settings

- Use strong authentication - Require client identification
- Implement least privilege - Give clients minimal necessary capabilities
- Regular review - Audit settings periodically

### Performance optimization

Optimize application performance:

- Appropriate persistence - Use only necessary message storage
- Efficient channel rules - Avoid overly broad or complex patterns
- Rate limiting - Prevent abuse while allowing legitimate usage
- Regional optimization - Configure for your user base geography

### Operational considerations

Design for operational efficiency:

- Documentation - Keep records of settings and their purposes
- Change management - Have procedures for settings changes
- Monitoring - Track the impact of configuration changes
- Backup - Maintain backups of critical configurations

Application settings provide fine-grained control over your Ably application's behavior, enabling you to optimize performance, security, and functionality for your specific use case.
