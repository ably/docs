      LiveSync enables you to synchronize changes in your database to frontend clients at scale. LiveSync is designed to be database agnostic with support for PostgreSQL and MongoDB. It uses Ably's global message delivery network to sync app data in realtime.

      LiveSync automatically streams changes you make in your database to clients. It keeps those clients automatically in sync with the source of truth in your database. LiveSync is database agnostic and has hosted connector support for Postgres and MongoDB.
