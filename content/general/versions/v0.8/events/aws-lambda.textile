As part of "Reactor Events":/general/events, it is possible to integrate with various systems.

"AWS Lambda Functions":https://aws.amazon.com/lambda provide event-driven serverless compute functions which allow users to easily run code whenever events are sent to it. These can be very useful for integrating into various other AWS systems.

h2(#tutorials). Tutorials & Examples

If you would like to just dive in and see an example of this being implemented, then take a look at our "AWS Lambda tutorial":/tutorials/reactor-event-aws.

For more details on the specifics of how Reactor Events and our integrations work, check out our "Reactor Events documentation":/general/events.

h2(#fields). Rule fields

- AWS Region := The region you chose for your "AWS Lambda function":https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#lambda_region
- Function Name := The name you gave your "AWS Lambda function":https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html
- AWS Authentication Scheme := the "authentication scheme":https://support.ably.com/support/solutions/articles/3000071908 you wish to use for your function. Either @AWS Credentials@ or @ARN of an assumable role@
- Qualifier := optional qualifier for your AWS Lambda function
- "Source":/general/events#sources := Choose which of @Message@ or @Presence@ events on channels should activate this Reactor Event Rule.
- Channel filter := An optional filter, which allows the Rule to be applied to a restricted set of channels. This can be specified as a regular expression, allowing for swathes of channels to be used

<br/>

If the Rule is using *AWS Credentials* to authenticate, it will also have the following options:

- AWS Credentials := a key:value pair which match your "AWS credentials":https://support.ably.com/support/solutions/articles/3000071908

<br/>

If the Rule is using *ARN of an assumable role* to authenticate, it will also have the following options:

- Assume Role ARN := your "ARN":https://support.ably.com/support/solutions/articles/3000071908 which will work for this AWS Lambda function

h2(#restrictions). Restrictions

At present, it is not possible to "batch":/general/event#batching messages to AWS Lambda Functions, nor can messages be "encoded":/general/events#encoding in anything besides JSON.
