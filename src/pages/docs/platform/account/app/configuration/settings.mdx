The Settings section allows you to configure your application's core settings, security requirements, and protocol support. Configure your application settings in the [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/settings).

![App settings interface](../../../../../../images/content/screenshots/dash/app-settings.png)

## Application settings <a id="application-settings"/>

### Basic application configuration <a id="basic-configuration"/>

The following settings define your application's identity:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| App ID | Unique identifier for your application. |
| Name | Friendly name for your application. |

### Security settings <a id="security-settings"/>

Configure security requirements that apply across your entire application:

| Security setting | Description |
|---|---|
| TLS required | Enforce encrypted connections for all clients. |

<Aside data-type='note'>
When TLS required is enabled, this setting overrides any channel settings and ensures that all client connections must use encrypted transport protocols.
</Aside>

### Application status <a id="application-status"/>

Control whether your application accepts connections and processes requests:

| Status setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Active | Application operational status. |
| Enabled | Service availability status. |

## Protocol Adapter Settings <a id="protocol-adapter-settings"/>

Protocol adapters allow clients using standard messaging protocols to connect to your Ably application without requiring Ably-specific client libraries:

| Protocol | Description |
|---|---|
| [Pusher protocol support](/docs/protocols/pusher) | Compatibility with Pusher client libraries (optional). |
| [PubNub protocol support](/docs/protocols/pubnub) | Compatibility with PubNub client libraries (always-on). |
| [MQTT protocol support](/docs/protocols/mqtt) | Standard MQTT messaging protocol support (always-on). |
