Starting with iOS 15, Apple supports a power-efficient way to request location through the location push service extension.

The following table explains how to receive location push notifications:

|_. Action |_. Details |
| Request location token | Call @CLLocationManager.startMonitoringLocationPushes(completion:)@ within the @ARTPushRegistererDelegate.didActivateAblyPush(:)@ delegate method. This delegate method is the callback for @ARTRealtime.push.activate()@. |
| Register with Ably | Call @ARTPush.didRegisterForLocationNotifications(withDeviceToken:realtime:)@ when you receive the location push token. Note the "Location" in the method name to distinguish it from regular push tokens. |
| Handle result | Use the @ARTPushRegistererDelegate.didUpdateAblyPush:@ callback, which indicates whether the token was successfully saved. |
