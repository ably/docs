The user that creates an Ably account is assigned the account owner role. An account owner has permission to undertake any action within an account, such as inviting new users. There are two other account roles that inherit a subset of an account owner's permissions. An account can only have a single account owner.

h2(#roles). User roles

Users can be assigned to the following roles. Each user may be assigned multiple roles:

* Developer
* Billing
* Admin
* Owner

User roles have the following permissions:

h3(#sso). Disconnect SSO provider

If you use SSO (Single Sign-On) to log in to your Ably account, you must first set a password and disconnect your SSO provider before closing your account. The self-service account closure process requires a password to authenticate the closure request. The following steps set a password and disconnect your SSO provider:

* Log in to your "account":https://ably.com/accounts/any using your current SSO method (Google or GitHub).
* Navigate to *Account* then "My Settings.":https://ably.com/users/edit
* In the *Password* section, click *Change your password*.
* Click *Update my personal settings* to save the changes.
* Scroll to the *Login provider* section.
* Click *remove connection* next to the SSO provider/s you want to disconnect.
* After completing these steps, return to the instructions above to "close your account":#close.
