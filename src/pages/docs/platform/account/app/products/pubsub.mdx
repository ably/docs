The Pub/Sub section in your Ably dashboard provides a centralized hub for managing realtime messaging across your application. From this overview page, you can quickly access getting started guides for different platforms, explore ready-to-use examples, and review recent product updates through the changelog.

The dashboard makes it easy to jump into channel monitoring, review implementation patterns, and stay updated with the latest Pub/Sub features and fixes.

## Channels <a id="channels"/>

The channels interface serves as your primary dashboard for monitoring and managing all pub/sub messaging activity across your application. This section provides realtime visibility into channel performance, connection patterns, and message flow, enabling you to quickly identify issues and optimize your messaging implementation.

Navigate to the channels section through the dashboard sidebar under Products > Pub/Sub > Channels. The main channels view displays all active channels in a clean, searchable interface that makes it easy to monitor your entire messaging infrastructure at a glance.

### Channel browser functionality <a id="channel-browser"/>

The channel finder search box allows you to quickly locate specific channels by name - essential when managing applications with numerous channels across different features or namespaces. Simply enter a channel name or partial match to filter the results and find the channels you need to inspect.

The interface shows exactly how many channels are currently active with a counter display, giving you immediate awareness of your application's messaging scope and helping you track channel growth over time.

Each channel entry in the list displays key information for rapid assessment:

| Column | Information displayed | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Channel name | The full identifier for the messaging channel | Identify specific channels and namespaces |
| Connection count | Real-time number of clients currently connected | Monitor traffic patterns and detect issues |
| Inspect button | Eye icon for detailed channel access | Access advanced monitoring and configuration |

The connection count column is particularly valuable for identifying channels experiencing high traffic, unusual activity patterns, or potential connection issues. Channels with unexpectedly high or low connection counts can indicate performance problems, client-side issues, or changes in user behavior that need investigation.

## Channel inspection <a id="inspection"/>

When you click the inspect button (eye icon) next to any channel in the channels list, you access a comprehensive channel monitoring interface that provides deep visibility into that specific channel's behavior, performance, and configuration.

### Channel inspection overview <a id="inspection-overview"/>

The inspection page opens with a detailed overview showing critical channel information and realtime metrics. The header displays the full channel name with a copy button for easy reference, along with breadcrumb navigation back to the main channels list.

#### Live analytics and visualization

The inspection interface provides two primary analytics sections with live, updating charts that help you understand channel behavior over time.

##### Messages analytics

The messages chart displays realtime inbound and outbound message flow with color-coded tracking for different message types. Use this to identify message patterns and delivery bottlenecks.

##### Occupancy analytics

The occupancy chart tracks connections, publishers, subscribers, and presence members over time. Use this data to understand user engagement patterns and optimize your messaging architecture.

#### Channel configuration and rules

The rules section provides comprehensive configuration options for controlling channel behavior and security requirements. You can configure three categories of rules:

| Rule category | Configuration options | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Storage rules | Persist last message, persist all messages | Control message persistence and history retention |
| Channel rules | Identification required, TLS required | Enforce security requirements |
| Feature rules | Push notifications, message annotations/updates/deletes | Enable advanced capabilities |

#### Integrations

The integrations section allows you to connect channels to external services and configure automated workflows triggered by channel activity.

Use the **Add integration** button to set up new external connections.
