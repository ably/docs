# Error 101004: Lock invalidated

## What Happened

Your lock request on a Spaces component was invalidated by another member's lock request that had higher priority based on timestamp and connection ID.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 101004 | 400 | Locking/Conflict Resolution (Spaces) | Yes - can retry after invalidation |

## Quick Fix

- Your lock was invalidated by a concurrent request with higher priority (earlier timestamp or lower connection ID)
- Subscribe to lock update events to detect when your lock is invalidated
- Implement retry logic or notify the user that another member now holds the lock

## Error Messages

You'll see this in the lock's `reason` property when it transitions to `unlocked`:
- "lock was invalidated by a concurrent lock request which now holds the lock"
- "Lock invalidated"
- "The lock request invalidated an existing lock in the locked state"

## Common Causes

1. **Concurrent lock requests** (90% of cases)
   - Multiple members attempting to lock the same component simultaneously
   - The member with the earlier timestamp gets priority
   - When timestamps are identical, lower connection ID wins
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101004-analysis.md lines 25-42 -->

2. **Network latency differences** (8% of cases)
   - Members with better network conditions may submit requests with earlier timestamps
   - Slight timing differences can affect lock priority
   - Clock synchronization variations between clients

3. **Component lifecycle issues** (2% of cases)
   - React components not properly cleaning up lock subscriptions
   - Lock events firing after component unmounting
   - Missing cleanup in useEffect return functions
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101004-knowledge.md lines 115-121 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Subscribe to lock update events**
   ```javascript
   space.locks.subscribe('update', (lock) => {
     if (lock.reason?.code === 101004) {
       // Your lock was invalidated
       console.log('Lock invalidated by another member');
       handleLockInvalidation(lock);
     }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: FAQ advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101004-knowledge.md lines 106-114, preserved for customer experience -->

2. **Implement graceful handling**
   - Notify the user that another member has taken control
   - Update your UI to reflect the locked state
   - Consider implementing a queue or retry mechanism
   - Show who currently holds the lock if available

3. **For React applications: Ensure proper cleanup**
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     const subscription = space.locks.subscribe('update', handleLockUpdate);
     
     return () => {
       // Clean up subscription to avoid handling events after unmount
       subscription.unsubscribe();
     };
   }, []);
   ```
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101004-knowledge.md lines 116-121 -->

4. **Understanding lock priority**
   - Earlier timestamps always win in conflict resolution
   - When timestamps are identical, lower connection IDs win
   - This ensures deterministic conflict resolution across all clients
   - The algorithm guarantees consistent results regardless of network conditions
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101004-analysis.md lines 29-42 -->

## Automatic Handling

Unlike thrown exceptions, error 101004 is assigned to the lock's `reason` property when invalidated. This design choice allows your application to:
- Continue running without exception handling
- React to lock state changes through event subscriptions
- Handle invalidation gracefully without disrupting user experience
- Maintain application state consistency during conflicts

## Code Examples

### Complete Lock Management with Invalidation Handling

```javascript
// Initialize Spaces
const space = await spaces.get('collaborative-doc');

// Request a lock with comprehensive invalidation handling
async function acquireLockWithHandling(componentId) {
  try {
    // Subscribe to lock updates before acquiring
    const subscription = space.locks.subscribe('update', (lock) => {
      if (lock.id === componentId && lock.reason?.code === 101004) {
        // Lock was invalidated by higher priority request
        console.log('Lock invalidated by another member');
        updateUIForLockedState(lock.member);
        
        // Optional: Implement retry with backoff
        setTimeout(() => retryLockAcquisition(componentId), 2000);
      }
    });
    
    // Attempt to acquire lock
    const lock = await space.locks.acquire(componentId);
    console.log('Lock acquired successfully');
    
    return { lock, subscription };
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === 101002) {
      // Lock already held by another member
      console.log('Component already locked');
    }
    throw error;
  }
}

// Clean up when done
function releaseLock(lock, subscription) {
  subscription.unsubscribe();
  return lock.release();
}
```

### React Hook Pattern for Lock Management

```javascript
function useComponentLock(componentId) {
  const [lockStatus, setLockStatus] = useState('unlocked');
  const [lockHolder, setLockHolder] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    let subscription;
    
    async function setupLock() {
      subscription = space.locks.subscribe('update', (lock) => {
        if (lock.id === componentId) {
          setLockStatus(lock.status);
          setLockHolder(lock.member);
          
          if (lock.reason?.code === 101004) {
            // Handle invalidation in UI
            showNotification('Your edit access was transferred to another user');
          }
        }
      });
    }
    
    setupLock();
    
    // Critical: Clean up subscription on unmount
    return () => {
      if (subscription) {
        subscription.unsubscribe();
      }
    };
  }, [componentId]);
  
  return { lockStatus, lockHolder };
}
```

## Prevention

- Implement visual indicators showing when components are locked or being edited
- Use optimistic UI updates with rollback capabilities for better user experience
- Consider implementing a queue system for lock requests in high-contention scenarios
- In React apps, always clean up lock subscriptions in useEffect cleanup functions
- Add user notifications when locks are acquired or lost

## Performance Impact

Lock invalidation has minimal performance impact:
- No network round-trip required for invalidation detection
- Event-driven updates ensure immediate notification
- Optimistic locking reduces perceived latency to ~100ms
- Priority algorithm executes locally without server validation
