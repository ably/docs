title: Object storage
intro: "Object storage provides durable persistence for LiveObjects with configurable retention periods up to 90 days by default. Data automatically expires after the retention period, resetting channels to their initial empty state."

## Default object storage - 90 days <a id="default-persistence"/>

Ably durably stores all objects on a channel for a retention period that is configured to 90 days by default. If the data is not updated within the retention period, it automatically expires. After expiry, the channel is reset to its initial state and only includes an empty <If lang="javascript">[channel object](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#channel-object)</If><If lang="swift,java">[root object](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#root-object)</If>.

## Store objects outside of Ably <a id="outside-persistence"/>

You can store your objects outside of Ably by obtaining the channel objects via the [REST API](/docs/liveobjects/rest-api-usage#fetching-objects) and storing them in your own database. This is useful if you want to keep a permanent record of the objects on a channel or if you want to perform analytics on the data.

In order to receive notifications when the objects on a channel are updated, use [inband objects](/docs/liveobjects/inband-objects) to receive updates as regular channel messages.

If you're interested in exporting objects to your own systems using [integration rules](/docs/platform/integrations/webhooks), please [get in touch](https://ably.com/support) with your requirements.

## Operation storage <a id="operation-persistence"/>

When you update an object, the change is expressed as an [operation](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/operations). Ably sends this as an [object message](/docs/metadata-stats/stats#messages) on the channel. Like all messages, Ably stores object messages for two minutes by default.

This means that if a client disconnects from Ably for a short period of time, it can automatically retrieve any operations it may have missed when it reconnects. If a client disconnects for longer than two minutes, Ably sends the client the latest state of the objects on the channel (which are durably stored for 90 days) when it reconnects, ensuring the client remains fully synchronized.

Operations themselves are not included in the [history](/docs/storage-history/history) or [rewind](/docs/channels/options/rewind) backlog of a channel. Instead, you should interact with objects directly via the client library.

## Object size limit <a id="limits"/>

The channel object has a maximum size limit, the default is 6.5(MB). This takes into account the size of every LiveObject (Map and Counter). When calculating the size of a channel object, Ably ignores any object or map entry with a [tombstone](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#tombstones).

A `LiveCounter` is a double-precision floating-point number and has a size of 8 bytes.

The size of a `LiveMap` object is calculated as the sum of the length of all keys plus the size of all values where:

* `string` values are the length of the string
* `number` values are 8 bytes
* `boolean` values are 1 byte
* `bytes` values are the length of the byte array
* JSON-serializable object or array values are equal to the length of their corresponding JSON strings
