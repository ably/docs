meta_description: "API reference for the ChatClient class in the Ably Chat JavaScript SDK."
meta_keywords: "Ably Chat SDK, JavaScript, ChatClient API, constructor, dispose, rooms, connection, clientId, realtime"
---

The `ChatClient` class is the main entry point for using the Ably Chat SDK. It provides access to chat rooms, connection management, and the underlying Ably Realtime client.

The Chat SDK is built on top of the Ably Pub/Sub SDK and uses that to establish a connection with Ably. Instantiate a realtime client using the Pub/Sub SDK and pass the generated client into the Chat constructor.

<Code>
```javascript
import { LogLevel } from '@ably/chat'

const realtimeClient = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}', clientId: '<clientId>'});
const chatClient = new ChatClient(realtimeClient, { logLevel: LogLevel.Error });
```
</Code>

An API key is required to authenticate with Ably. API keys are used either to authenticate directly with Ably using basic authentication, or to generate tokens for untrusted clients using [JWT authentication](/docs/auth/token#jwt).

<Aside data-type='important'>
Basic authentication should never be used on the client-side in production, as it exposes your Ably API key. Instead, use JWT authentication.
</Aside>

## Properties

The `ChatClient` interface has the following properties:

<Table id='ChatClientProperties'>

## Create a new chat client <a id="constructor"/>

<MethodSignature>{`new ChatClient(realtime: Realtime, clientOptions?: ChatClientOptions)`}</MethodSignature>

Create a new `ChatClient` instance by passing an Ably Realtime client and optional configuration options.

<Code>
```javascript
import * as Ably from 'ably';
import { ChatClient } from '@ably/chat';

const realtimeClient = new Ably.Realtime({
  key: '{{API_KEY}}',
  clientId: 'user-123'
});

const chatClient = new ChatClient(realtimeClient, clientOptions);
```
</Code>

### Parameters <a id="constructor-params"/>

The `ChatClient()` constructor takes the following parameters:

<Table id='ConstructorParameters'>

| Parameter | Required | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| realtime | Required | An instance of the Ably Realtime client, configured with your API key and a `clientId`. The `clientId` is required for all chat operations. | Ably.Realtime |
| clientOptions | Optional | Configuration options for the Chat client. | <Table id='ChatClientOptions'/> |

</Table>

## Dispose of the chat client <a id="dispose"/>

<MethodSignature>{`chatClient.dispose(): Promise<void>`}</MethodSignature>

Disposes of the ChatClient instance and releases all resources, including all chat rooms. After calling this method, the ChatClient instance is no longer usable.

<Code>
```javascript
await chatClient.dispose();
```
</Code>

### Returns <a id="dispose-returns"/>

`Promise<void>`

Returns a promise. The promise is fulfilled when the client has been disposed, or rejected with an [`ErrorInfo`](#errorinfo) object.

## ErrorInfo <a id="errorinfo"/>

A standardized, generic Ably error object that contains an Ably-specific status code, and a generic HTTP status code. All errors returned from Ably are compatible with the `ErrorInfo` structure.

<Table id='ErrorInfo'>

| Property | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | Ably-specific error code. | Number |
| statusCode | HTTP status code corresponding to this error, where applicable. | Number |
| message | Additional information about the error. | String |
| cause | The underlying cause of the error, where applicable. | String, ErrorInfo, or Error |

</Table>

## Example

<Code>
```javascript
import * as Ably from 'ably';
import { ChatClient, LogLevel } from '@ably/chat';

const realtimeClient = new Ably.Realtime({
  key: '{{API_KEY}}',
  clientId: 'user-123'
});

const chatClient = new ChatClient(realtimeClient, {
  logLevel: LogLevel.Debug
});

// Access rooms
const room = await chatClient.rooms.get('my-room');

// Check connection status
console.log(chatClient.connection.status);

// Get current user ID
console.log(chatClient.clientId);
```
</Code>
