Ably Chat is a product dedicated to making it quick and easy to build chat functionality into new and existing applications. Use Ably Chat to build things such as a 1:1 customer support feature, or add a chat component to a livestreaming platform that serves hundreds of thousands of users.

The Chat SDK contains a set of purpose-built APIs that abstract away the complexities involved in how you would architect chat features. It utilizes Ably's platform to benefit from all of the same performance guarantees and scaling potential.

## Why Chat

### Built for Serious Scale & Reliability

Ably Chat is powered by Ably's globally distributed platform that handles **550 billion messages per month** and **1 billion+ connections per month**, serving the world's most demanding workloads with **100% uptime over 5+ years**. With a global edge network featuring **635 points of presence**, Ably Chat delivers messages with **&lt;50ms median roundtrip latency** and provides automatic multi-region failover to ensure your chat experiences are always available.

### Cost-Effective Scalability

Scale without penalty using Ably's usage-based pricing model that charges by-the-minute for what you actually use. The platform includes built-in cost optimization features like **message batching** to reduce consumption, and **volume discounts** that lower your overall cost as you grow. This means you can power more chat functionality within budget without stifling innovation for fear of cost.

### Developer Productivity

Get building with intuitive APIs and comprehensive SDKs across multiple platforms. The Chat SDK abstracts away architectural complexity, enabling your team to rapidly ship exceptional chat experiences. Pre-built **React UI Kits** and **React Hooks** accelerate development even further, letting you focus on creating unique experiences rather than building chat infrastructure from scratch.

### Enterprise-Ready

Ably Chat supports enterprise requirements with **HIPAA and SOC2 compliance** options, dedicated clusters, custom domains (CNAME), SSO integration, and premium support with **sub-15 minute response times**. Whether you're building for thousands or millions of users, Ably Chat scales with your business needs.

## Chat features <a id="features"/>

Ably Chat provides the following key features:

* [Rooms and messages](#rooms)
* [Presence](#presence)
* [Message reactions](#message-reactions)
* [Typing indicators](#typing)
* [Room reactions](#reactions)
* [AI Moderation](#moderation)
* [React UI Kits](#react-ui-kits)
* [React Hooks](#react-hooks)

### Rooms and messages <a id="rooms"/>

[Rooms](/docs/chat/rooms) are used to organize and separate your users and chat messages into 'chat rooms'. They are the entry object into chat and provide access to all other chat features, such as messages, online status, and typing indicators.

Each room can represent a 1:1 chat between an agent and a customer, a private message between two users in a chat application, a group conversation, or the chat section of a livestream with thousands of users.

[Messages](/docs/chat/rooms/messages) enable users to communicate with one another in the room. Messages sent by users are received by all those who have subscribed to receive them within that room.

### Presence <a id="presence"/>

[Presence](/docs/chat/rooms/presence) enables you to display the status of every user in the room, such as whether a user is online or offline. Users can also set additional information about their profile or set a custom status, such as 'Away'.

### Message reactions <a id="message-reactions"/>

[Message reactions](/docs/chat/rooms/message-reactions) enable users to send reactions to messages, such as üëç or ‚ù§. Users can also see which other users reacted to a message.

### Typing indicators <a id="typing"/>

[Typing indicators](/docs/chat/rooms/typing) let users see when others start and stop typing a message. They enable you to display a message such as *John is typing...* or when too many users are typing, something like *Multiple people are typing...* or *12 people are typing...*.

### Room reactions <a id="reactions"/>

[Room reactions](/docs/chat/rooms/reactions) enable users to broadcast ephemeral sentiments using emojis, such as üëç or ‚ù§. Room reactions are used to broadcast a general sentiment to the entire room rather than reacting to a single message. A common use case is sports fans all sending a heart when their team scores.

### Moderation <a id="moderation"/>

[AI Moderation](/docs/chat/moderation) enables you to automatically detect and handle inappropriate content in chat messages. Using AI-powered content filtering, you can identify potentially harmful messages, spam, or content that violates your community guidelines, and take appropriate action either before they reach other users, or retroactively.

You can integrate seamlessly in minutes with a number of third-party moderation providers to take advantage of powerful AI models, or bring your own infrastructure via integrations with the likes of AWS Lambda to customize your experience.

### React UI Kits <a id="react-ui-kits"/>

[React UI Kits](/docs/chat/getting-started/react-ui-components) provide pre-built, customizable React components that make it even faster to add chat functionality to your applications. These components handle the presentation layer and user interactions, allowing you to focus on your application logic rather than building chat UI from scratch.

The UI Kits include components for message lists, input fields, user avatars, typing indicators, and more. They're designed to be flexible and themeable to match your application's design system. They are fully [open-source](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-react-ui-components), so you can easily take the code as a starting point to further customize your own components.

### React Hooks <a id="react-hooks"/>

[React Hooks](/docs/chat/getting-started/react) provide a set of custom hooks that integrate seamlessly with React applications. These hooks manage the state and lifecycle of chat features, making it simple to build reactive chat interfaces that automatically update when new messages arrive or user presence changes.

## Demo

Take a look at a [livestream basketball game](https://ably-livestream-chat-demo.vercel.app) with some simulated users chatting built using the Chat SDK. The [source code](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/tree/main/demo) is available in GitHub.
