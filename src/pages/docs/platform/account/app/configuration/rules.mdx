The rules section in your Ably dashboard enables you to enforce settings and configure features for channels, rooms, or spaces within specified namespaces. Configure and manage your rules in the [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/rules) under the rules section. Rules provide granular control over message persistence, authentication requirements, security settings, and advanced functionality across your application.

## Your rules <a id="your-rules"/>

The rules interface displays your configured namespace rules and their applied settings:

### Channel namespace configuration <a id="namespace-configuration"/>

Each rule is defined by a channel namespace pattern that determines which channels the rule applies to:

| Configuration element | Description |
|---|---|
| Channel namespace | The namespace pattern that determines which channels the rule applies to |

For example, a namespace `coco` would apply to channels matching the pattern, with example matches like `coco:data` or `coco`.
