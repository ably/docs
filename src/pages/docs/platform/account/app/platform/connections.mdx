The Connections section in your Ably dashboard shows you exactly who's connected to your application and which channels they're attached to. Monitor your connections through the [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/connections) under the Connections section. This interface provides visibility into active client connections and their channel subscriptions, enabling you to understand how your application is being used in realtime.
