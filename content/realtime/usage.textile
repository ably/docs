The Realtime library attempts to establish, and maintain, a single connection to the Ably realtime service. The library extends, and depends on, the "REST library":/rest/usage, which provides access to the "REST-based Ably APIs":/rest-api, and the "Auth API":/rest/authentication in particular.

Whereas the REST API is stateless, the Realtime API maintains connection and channel state.

The Realtime client library is available for "several popular environments":https://ably.io/download/realtime-client-libraries, with the same functionality and similar API supported across all languages. You can view this documentation in each of the supported languages using the language selector navigation.

<div lang="javascript">The Realtime library for browser Javascript environments is loaded from the Ably CDN.

<pre lang="javascript"><code lang="javascript"><script lang="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.ably.io/ably-min.js"></code></pre>

The script contains both Realtime library and all its dependencies. To instance the Realtime library:

<pre lang="javascript"><code lang="javascript">var realtime = new Ably.Realtime(options);</code></pre>
</div>

<div lang="nodejs">The Realtime library for nodejs targets clients and servers and is obtainable as a module "directly from npm":https://npmjs.org/package/ably-js. Install with

<pre lang="sh"><code lang="sh">npm install ably-js</code></pre>

The ably-js module contains both the REST and Realtime libraries; each is exported separately by the module. To instance the Realtime library:

<pre lang="javascript"><code lang="javascript">var Ably = require('ably-js');
var realtime = new Ably.Realtime(options);</code></pre>

</div>

<div lang="ruby">The Realtime library for Ruby is obtainable as a RubyGem direcly using

<pre lang="sh"><code lang="sh">gem install ably-realtime</code></pre>

If using bundler, simply add the following to your Gemfile and run @bundle install@:

<pre lang="ruby"><code lang="ruby">gem 'ably-realtime'</code></pre>

</div>

<div lang="java">The Realtime library for Java is downloadable as a JAR from 
"https://github.com/ably/ably-java/releases":https://github.com/ably/ably-java/releases.

Ensure this JAR is included in your classpath.

<pre lang="java"><code lang="java">import io.ably.rest.AblyRealtime;
AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime(options);</code></pre>

</div>

The required and supported "options":#options are described below.

h1. Realtime API Reference

h2(#constructor). Constructor

h6[javascript]. AblyRealtime(keyStr)

h6[nodejs]. AblyRealtime(keyStr)

h6[ruby]. Ably::Realtime.new(keyStr)

h6[java]. AblyRealtime(String keyStr)

Instance the library passing only a key string. All other options assume default values.

h6[javascript]. AblyRealtime(options)

h6[nodejs]. AblyRealtime(options)

h6[ruby]. Ably::Realtime.new(options)

h6[java]. AblyRealtime(Options options)

Instance the library specifying an "Options":#options instance.

The Realtime constructor is used to instance the library.The Realtime library may be instanced multiple times with different @options@ in any given context. Except where specified otherwise, instances operate independently of one another.

The Realtime library needs to know the application identifier, or @appId@, and also requires credentials or other information required to be able to authenticate to the Ably service. The application id can be specified explicitly with an @appId@ option, or is more typically given implicitly by passing a @key@ or @token@ option when constructing the library.

The @key@ option takes a key string, as obtained from the "application dashboard":https://ably.io/dashboard. Use this option if you wish to use Basic authentication, or if you want to be able to request tokens without needing to defer to
a separate entity to sign token requests. Note that initialising the library with a @key@ does not necessarily mean that the library will use Basic auth; but knowing the key it is able to create and sign token requests and use token authentication when necessary.

The @token@ option takes a token string, and assumes the token has been obtained from some other instance that requested the token. Use the token option if you are provided with a token to use and you do not have a key (or do not have a key with the capabilities that you require).

Since tokens are short-lived, it is rarely sufficient to start with a token, without the means for refreshing it. The @authUrl@ and @authCallback@ options are provided to allow a user of the library to issue new token requests as required; these options even permit the library to be instanced without either @key@ or @token@, and an initial token
will be obtained when required.

See "Options":#options for the full set of initialisation options.

h2(#methods). Methods

h6(#close)[default]. close()

h6(#close)[java]. public void close()

This simply calls "connection.close()":/realtime/connection#close. Causes the connection to close, entering the @closed@ state. Once closed, the library will not attempt to re-establish the connection without a call to @connect()@.

h2(#members). Public members

The Realtime object exposes the following public <span lang="default">properties</span><span lang="java">fields</span>.

- <span lang="java">public final</span>connection := A reference to the "connection":/realtime/connection object for this library instance.

- <span lang="java">public final</span>channels := The collection of channels instanced, indexed by channel name. See "channels and messages":/realtime/channels-messages/ for more information.

h2(#options). Options

<div lang="java">
The Ably constructor's @Options@ argument is an instance of @io.ably.types.Options@, constructed either with the default no-argument constructor or with a key string. The following options may be specified.
</div>

<div lang="default">
The Ably constructor's @Options@ argument is an object with one or more of the following properties.
</div>

- appId := The application id. This option is only required if the application id cannot be inferred either from a @key@ or @token@ option. If given, it is the application id as indicated on the "application dashboard":https://ably.io/dashboard.

- key := The full key string, as obtained from the "application dashboard":https://ably.io/dashboard. Use this option if you wish to use Basic authentication, or wish to be able to issue tokens without needing to defer to a separate entity to sign token requests.

- token := A token string, as the value of the @id@ property of a @token_details@ component of a token response.

- authCallback := A <span lang="default">function</span><span lang="java">TokenCallback instance</span> to call when a new token is required.</span>. The role of the callback is to generate a signed @token request@ which may then be submitted by the library to the @requestToken@ API. See "authentication":/rest/authentication for details of the token request format and associated API calls.

- authUrl := A URL that the library may use to obtain a signed token request. For example, this can be used by a client to obtain signed token requests from an application server.

- authHeaders := A set of headers to be added to any request made to the @authUrl@.  Useful when an application requires these to be added to validate the request or implement the response.

- authParams := A set of @POST@ params to be added to any request made to the @authUrl@.  Useful when an application require these to be added to validate the request or implement the response.

- encrypted := _false, or in the case of a browser client, to the state of the document that loaded the library_ A boolean value, indicating whether or not a TLS ("SSL") secure connection should be used.  Note that unpaid Ably accounts are unable to use encrypted Realtime connections.

- clientId := A client id, used for identifying this client for presence purposes. The clientId can be any string. This option is primarily intended to be used in situations where the library is instanced with a key; note that a clientId may also be implicit in a token used to instance the library; an error will be raised if a clientId specified here conflicts with the clientId implicit in the token.

- <div lang="javascript,nodejs,ruby">log</div> := Parameters to control the log output of the library. The supplied value must be an object that may contain one or both of the following entries:
<ul><li>@level@: a number controlling the verbosity of the output from 1 (minimum, errors only) to 4 (most verbose);</li>
<li>@handler@: a function to handle each line of log output. If @handler@ is not specified, @console.log@ is used.</li></ul>
Note that the log level and log handler have global scope in the library and will thus not act independently between library instances when multiple library instances are existing concurrently.

- <div lang="java">logLevel</div> := An int controlling the verbosity of the output from 1 (minimum, errors only) to 4 (most verbose). Note that the @logLevel@ is a static variable in the library and will thus not act independently between library instances when multiple library instances are existing concurrently.

- <div lang="java">logHandler</div> := A @PrintStream@ to handle each line of log output. If @logHandler@ is not specified, @System.out@ is used. Note that the @logHandler@ is a static variable in the library and will thus not act independently between library instances when multiple library instances are existing concurrently.

- <div lang="javascript,nodejs">transports</div> := In those environments supporting multiple transports, an array of transports to use, in descending order of preference. <span lang="javascript">In the browser environment the available transports are:
@web_socket@, @flash_socket@, @xhr@, @jsonp@.</span>

- useTextProtocol := _false_ The browser client library detects whether or not the browser has the capability to use the binary protocol, and enables this option if the browser requires the use of the text protocol.

- queueMessages := _true_ If false, this disables the default behaviour whereby the library queues messages on a connection in the disconnected or connecting states. The default behaviour allows applications to submit messages immediately upon instancing the library, without having to wait for the connection to be established. Applications may use this option to disable that behaviour if they wish to have application-level control over the queueing under those conditions.

- recover := This option allows a connection to inherit the state of a previous connection that may have existed under an different instance of the Realtime library. This might typically be used by clients of the browser library to ensure connection state can be preserved when the user refreshes the page. See connection_state_recovery for further information on this option.
