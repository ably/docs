<Aside data-type="new">
The [Ably CLI](https://github.com/ably/ably-cli) is currently in Public Preview status.
</Aside>

The Ably CLI brings the full power of Ably to your terminal. You can use it to manage your Ably account and its resources, and to explore Ably's APIs and features.

It's a quick and easy way to simulate additional clients when testing how Ably works.

The Ably CLI interacts with:

* The [Control API](/docs/platform/account/control-api) to manage your Ably account and applications.
* [Pub/Sub](/docs/basics) to publish and subscribe to messages in realtime.
* [Chat](/docs/chat) to send messages, display typing indicators and react to what's happening in a chat room.
* [Spaces](/docs/spaces) to enter spaces and register member locations.

## Installation

The Ably CLI is available as an NPM package.

1. Install the Ably CLI:

<Code>
```shell
npm install -g @ably/cli
```
</Code>

2. Run the following to log in to your Ably account. This will prompt you to log into your Ably account and setup an access token for the Ably CLI. You can then set the default app and API key to use back in your terminal instance:

<Code>
```shell
ably login
```
</Code>

3. Start running commands in the CLI to create and interact with your Ably resources.

## Usage

After you have successfully authenticated and chosen your app and API key, you're ready to interact with Ably resources directly from your terminal.

For example, open two terminal instances and subscribe to one, and publish messages in the other:

To subscribe:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels subscribe channel-1
```
</Code>

To publish:

<Code>
```shell
# To publish 1 message:
ably channels publish channel-1 Hi!

# To publish 5 messages:
ably channels publish --count 5 channel-1 "Message number {{.Count}}"
```
</Code>

For a list of all available commands, run:

<Code>
```shell
ably help
```
</Code>
