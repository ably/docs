Signal when a member is typing to indicate to other members that a message is being written.

h2(#implementation). Implementation

Use the "presence":/presence-occupancy/presence feature to implement a typing indicator.

The member status can indicate whether they're currently typing. This status allows other members to see a visual cue, triggering an update event when a member begins typing to update the Chat UI for all members. For example, "Jane is typing...".

```[javascript]
    // Subscribe to any presence updates for the current presence set
    channel.presence.subscribe('update', (memberUpdate) => {
      // Event triggered for when someone has started or stopped typing.
      // Your custom functionality is required here to show the indication someone is typing for example:
      // - "John is typing..."
      // - or "Multiple people are typing..."
    });
```

Depending on the UI, it's advisable to show only a limited number of names of people who are typing, and if that number is exceeded, display a message such as "People are typing...".

h3(#example). Example of typing indicators

For the member, an event listener waits for a keypress before publishing an update to the presence set, updating this member's status with a string indicating they're typing. A timer is set to expire in five seconds to reset this status if no further keys have been pressed in that time.

The following is an example of configuring typing indicator updates using presence:

```[javascript]
    let isTyping = false;
    let typingInterval;
    let usersTyping = [];

    var client = new Ably.Realtime('{{API_KEY}}');
    var channel = client.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');

    // Subscribe to any presence updates for the current presence set
    channel.presence.subscribe('update', (memberUpdate) => {
      // find your user by their client id
      user = '';
      // Adding user to array of users typing
      usersTyping.push(user);
    });

    // Enter the member into the presence set
    channel.presence.enter((err) => {
      // Custom functionality to update UI for members that they are now online.
    });

    // Listener for when member presses a key on their keyboard
    document.addEventListener('keypress', (event) => {
      publishTyping(channel)
    }, false);

    // The member has pressed a key, publish to the presence channel
    // that they are, and initiate a timer to reset the typing indicator if no
    // further key presses are made within 5 seconds
    function publishTyping(channel) {
      if (isTyping === false) {
        channel.presence.update('is typing', (err) => {
          isTyping = true;

          typingInterval = setInterval(stopTyping(channel), 5000);
        });
      } else {
        clearInterval(typingInterval);
        typingInterval = setInterval(stopTyping(channel), 5000);
      }
    }

    // The timer has reached the end, the member hasn't pressed a key in the time
    // frame, so publish that they've stopped and remove them from the local usersTyping array.
    function stopTyping(channel) {
      channel.presence.update('has stopped typing', (err) => {
        const index = usersTyping.findIndex((userEntry) => {
          return userEntry.clientId === user.clientId;
        })

        usersTyping.splice(index, 1);
        isTyping = false
      });
    }
```
