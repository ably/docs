The history feature enables users to retrieve messages that have been previously sent in a room. Ably stores chat messages for 24 hours by default. You can extend this up to 30 days by "contacting us":https://forms.gle/SmCLNFoRrYmkbZSf8.

h2(#get). Retrieve previously sent messages

blang[javascript].
  Use the "@messages.get()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_js.Messages.html#get method to retrieve messages that have been previously sent to a room:

blang[react].
    Use the "@get()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_react.UseMessagesResponse.html#get method available from the response of the @useMessages@ hook to retrieve messages that have bene previously sent to a room.

```[javascript]
const historicalMessages = await room.messages.get({ orderBy: 'newestFirst', limit: 50 });
console.log(historicalMessages.items);

if (historicalMessages.hasNext()) {
  const next = await historicalMessages.next();
  console.log(next);
} else {
  console.log('End of messages');
}
```

```[react]
import { useMessages } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { get } = useMessages();

  const handleGetMessages = () => {
    // fetch the last 3 messages, oldest to newest
    get({ limit: 3, orderBy: 'oldestFirst' })
      .then((result) =>
        console.log('Previous messages: ', result.items));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleGetMessages}>Get Messages</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The following optional parameters can be passed when retrieving previously sent messages:

|_. Parameter |_. Description |
| start | Earliest time to retrieve messages from, as a unix timestamp in milliseconds. Messages with a timestamp equal to, or greater than, this value will be returned. |
| end | Latest time to retrieve messages from, as a unix timestamp in milliseconds. Messages with a timestamp less than this value will be returned. |
| orderBy | The order in which to retrieve messages from; either @oldestFirst@ or @newestFirst@. |
| limit | Maximum number of messages to be retrieved, up to 1,000. |

h2(#subscribe). Retrieve messages sent prior to subscribing

Users can also retrieve historical messages that were sent to a room before the point that they registered a listener by "subscribing":/chat/rooms/messages#subscribe. The order of messages returned is from most recent, to oldest. This is useful for providing conversational context when a user first joins a room, or when they subsequently rejoin it later on. It also ensures that the message history they see is continuous, without any overlap of messages being returned between their subscription and their history call.

blang[javascript].
  Use the "@getPreviousMessages()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_js.MessageSubscriptionResponse.html#getPreviousMessages function returned as part of a "message subscription":/chat/rooms/messages#subscribe response to only retrieve messages that were received before the listener was subscribed to the room:

blang[react].
  Use the "@getPrevious()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_react.UseMessagesResponse.html#getPreviousMessages method available from the response of the @useMessages@ hook to only retrieve messages that were received before the listener subscribed to the room. As long as a defined value is provided for the listener, and there are no message discontinuities, @getPreviousMessages()@ will return messages from the same point across component renders. If the listener becomes undefined, the subscription to messages will be removed. If you subsequently redefine the listener then @getPreviousMessages()@ will return messages from the new point of subscription.

```[javascript]
const { getPreviousMessages } = room.messages.subscribe(() => {
  console.log('New message received');
});

const historicalMessages = await getPreviousMessages({ limit: 50 });
console.log(historicalMessages.items);
if (historicalMessages.hasNext()) {
  const next = await historicalMessages.next();
  console.log(next);
} else {
  console.log('End of messages');
}
```

```[react]
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useMessages } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  const { getPreviousMessages } = useMessages({
    listener: (message) => {
      console.log('Received message: ', message);
    },
    onDiscontinuity: (error) => {
      console.log('Discontinuity detected:', error);
      setLoading(true);
    },
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    // once the listener is subscribed, `getPreviousMessages` will become available
    if (getPreviousMessages && loading) {
      getPreviousMessages({ limit: 10 }).then((result) => {
        console.log('Previous messages: ', result.items());
        setLoading(false);
      });
    }
  }, [getPreviousMessages, loading]);

  return <div>...</div>;
};
```
