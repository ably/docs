This error occurs when you attempt to use SDK functionality that requires an optional plugin or module that hasn't been installed or included in the build.

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40019 | 400 | Client Error (Missing Plugin) | No |

## Error messages

You may see one of these error messages:

| Error Message | SDK | Description |
|---------------|-----|-------------|
| `Missing Vcdiff decoder (https://github.com/ably-forks/vcdiff-decoder)` | JavaScript | VCDiff decoder plugin required for delta compression |
| `{pluginName} plugin not provided` | JavaScript | Generic message for any missing plugin |
| `LiveObjects plugin hasn't been installed, add runtimeOnly('io.ably:live-objects:<ably-version>') to your dependency tree` | Java | LiveObjects module required |
| `missing objects plugin` | Go | Experimental objects plugin not configured |

## Impact

This error only affects the specific operation that requires the missing plugin. Other SDK operations continue to work normally.

The error cannot be automatically retried - you must install the required plugin and restart your application.

## Troubleshooting

The following are common causes and resolutions for error 40019:

### VCDiff decoder missing (JavaScript)

| Error Message |
|---------------|
| `Missing Vcdiff decoder (https://github.com/ably-forks/vcdiff-decoder)` |

This occurs when:
- Your channel has delta compression enabled
- The SDK attempts to decode a VCDiff-encoded delta message
- The VCDiff decoder plugin is not installed or configured

To resolve this:

1. Install the VCDiff decoder plugin:

  <Code>
   ```shell
   npm install @ably/vcdiff-decoder
   ```
  </Code>

2. Include the plugin when initializing the Ably client:

  <Code>
   ```javascript
   import vcdiff from '@ably/vcdiff-decoder';

   const client = new Ably.Realtime({
     key: 'your-api-key',
     plugins: { vcdiff }
   });
   ```
  </Code>

{/* Source: Knowledge base solution from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 52-63 */}

**Note for React Native**: If you encounter `TextEncoder doesn't exist` errors, import a polyfill at your app's entry point:

<Code>
```javascript
// In index.js or App.js
import 'text-encoding-polyfill';
```
</Code>

{/* Source: Slack discussion from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 143-150 */}

### LiveObjects plugin missing (Java/Android)

| Error Message |
|---------------|
| `LiveObjects plugin hasn't been installed, add runtimeOnly('io.ably:live-objects:<ably-version>') to your dependency tree` |

This occurs when:
- You attempt to access `channel.liveObjects`
- The LiveObjects module is not included as a dependency

To resolve this:

**For Gradle projects:**

<Code>
```shell
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.ably:ably-android:1.x.x'
    runtimeOnly 'io.ably:live-objects:1.x.x' // Use same version as main SDK
}
```
</Code>

**For Maven projects:**

<Code>
```text
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.ably</groupId>
    <artifactId>live-objects</artifactId>
    <version>1.x.x</version> <!-- Same version as main SDK -->
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```
</Code>

### Experimental Objects plugin missing (Go)

| Error Message |
|---------------|
| `missing objects plugin` |

This occurs when:
- You call `PublishObjects` method
- The `ExperimentalObjectsPlugin` is not configured in ClientOptions

To resolve this:

Configure the experimental objects plugin when creating your client:

<Code>
```go
opts := &ably.ClientOptions{
    Key: "your-api-key",
    ExperimentalObjectsPlugin: &MyObjectsPlugin{}, // Implement plugin interface
}
client, _ := ably.NewRealtime(opts)
```
</Code>

### Modular build missing plugins (JavaScript)

| Error Message |
|---------------|
| `{pluginName} plugin not provided` |

This occurs when:
- You're using the modular JavaScript SDK build
- A required plugin is not included in your build configuration

To resolve this:

Include all required plugins when configuring the modular SDK:

<Code>
```javascript
import { Realtime } from 'ably/modular';
import {
  WebSocketTransport,
  FetchRequest,
  // Add other required plugins based on error message
} from 'ably/modular/plugins';

const client = new Realtime({
  key: 'your-api-key',
  plugins: {
    WebSocketTransport,
    FetchRequest,
    // Include all plugins your app needs
  }
});
```
</Code>

## Prevention

To avoid this error:

- Review the feature documentation to understand plugin requirements before implementation
- Keep plugin versions synchronized with your main SDK version
- Include only the plugins you need to minimize bundle size
- Test your application with the same build configuration used in production
- Document plugin dependencies in your project's README for team awareness
