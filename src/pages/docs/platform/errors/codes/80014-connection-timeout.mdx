# Error 80014: Connection timed out

## What Happened

Your application couldn't establish a connection to Ably within the timeout period, or a REST API request took too long to complete.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 80014 | 504/408 | Connection | Yes - SDK retries automatically |

## Quick Fix

- Check your internet connection stability
- Verify firewall allows access to `*.ably.io` on ports 80 and 443
- Increase timeout values for slow or mobile networks
- Test connection without VPN or proxy

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Unable to establish connection"
- "Connecting timeout"
- "Connection to Ably timed out after 10s"
- "request timed out" (REST operations)
- Faraday::TimeoutError (Ruby SDK specific)

## Common Causes

1. **Network connectivity issues** (50% of cases)
   - Slow or unstable internet connection
   - Network congestion during peak times
   - Mobile network switching between towers or poor signal
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 13-17 -->

2. **Firewall or proxy restrictions** (25% of cases)
   - Corporate firewalls blocking WebSocket connections
   - Security scanning adding delays
   - Proxy servers introducing connection overhead
   <!-- Source: FAQ content from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 133-136 -->

3. **REST API timeouts** (15% of cases)
   - Token request timeouts
   - Message publishing delays
   - High server load during peak usage
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 156-168, customer patterns -->

4. **Configuration issues** (10% of cases)
   - Default 10-second timeout too short for network conditions
   - Mobile or satellite connections needing longer timeouts
   - Geographic distance from nearest Ably data center
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-analysis.md lines 49-52 and Knowledge lines 18-19 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify network connectivity**
   - Test your internet connection stability
   - Try connecting from a different network
   - Check connection without VPN or proxy
   <!-- Source: FAQ advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 30-34 -->

2. **Check firewall configuration**
   - Ensure access to `*.ably.io` domains on ports 80 and 443
   - Verify WebSocket connections are allowed
   - Test from outside corporate network to isolate firewall issues
   <!-- Source: FAQ documentation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 134-136 -->

3. **Adjust timeout settings for your network**
   - Increase `realtimeRequestTimeout` for realtime connections (default: 10 seconds)
   - Increase `httpRequestTimeout` for REST operations (default: 10 seconds)
   - Configure appropriate timeouts for mobile applications
   - See [Connection Options Documentation](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection#client-options)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 82-90 -->

4. **Handle bursts of timeouts**
   - Timeouts often occur in bursts (e.g., 4-minute windows)
   - Implement circuit breaker patterns for REST operations
   - Monitor for patterns in timeout occurrences
   <!-- Source: Customer impact patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 172-177 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically retry connection attempts and REST requests after timeouts with exponential backoff. You don't need to implement your own retry logic. The SDK will:
- Retry the connection or request automatically
- Use progressive backoff to avoid overwhelming the network
- Eventually succeed when network conditions improve

## Code Examples

### Configuring Timeouts

```javascript
// JavaScript SDK
const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
  key: 'your-api-key',
  realtimeRequestTimeout: 15000, // 15 seconds for realtime connections
  httpRequestTimeout: 20000      // 20 seconds for REST operations
});
```
<!-- Code source: https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 83-90, essential for resolving timeout issues -->

```ruby
# Ruby SDK
client = Ably::Realtime.new(
  key: 'your-api-key',
  realtime_request_timeout: 15, # 15 seconds
  http_request_timeout: 20      # 20 seconds
)
```
<!-- Code source: Based on Ruby SDK patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-analysis.md line 35 -->

### Network-Aware Configuration

```javascript
// Adapt timeouts based on network type
const getTimeoutConfig = () => {
  const connection = navigator.connection || navigator.mozConnection || navigator.webkitConnection;
  
  if (connection?.effectiveType === '2g' || connection?.effectiveType === 'slow-2g') {
    return {
      realtimeRequestTimeout: 30000,  // 30 seconds for slow networks
      httpRequestTimeout: 45000       // 45 seconds for REST
    };
  }
  
  return {
    realtimeRequestTimeout: 10000,    // Default 10 seconds
    httpRequestTimeout: 15000         // Default 15 seconds
  };
};

const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
  key: 'your-api-key',
  ...getTimeoutConfig()
});
```
<!-- Code source: Based on best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 97-102, mobile network considerations -->

## Prevention

- **Configure appropriate timeouts**: Set realistic timeout values based on your users' network environment
- **Implement connection quality monitoring**: Detect network conditions and adapt behavior
- **Design for offline scenarios**: Build your application to handle temporary disconnections gracefully
- **Use regional endpoints**: Connect to the nearest Ably data center for optimal performance
- **Monitor timeout patterns**: Track when timeouts occur to identify network or configuration issues

<!-- Source: Prevention strategies from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 51-70 -->

## Performance Impact

This error indicates failed connection attempts or REST operations that can:
- Delay realtime features activation
- Cause message publishing to fail temporarily
- Impact user experience during connection establishment
- Create bursts of errors affecting multiple operations
