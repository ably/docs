Ably's presence feature allows clients or devices to announce their presence on a channel. Other devices or services may then subscribe to these presence events (such as entering, updating their state, or leaving the channel) in real time using our "realtime SDKs":/realtime, or via the "Ably Integrations":/general/integrations. You can also request a list of clients or devices that are online/offline on a channel at a particular point in time via the "REST API":/api/rest-api#presence.

 Furthermore, if persistence is enabled on the presence channel, you can also retrieve "presence history":/api/rest-sdk/history#presence-history for the channel, i.e, static data about historical presence states of your clients/devices. This operation also can be done using both Ably's "Realtime":/realtime and "REST":/rest libraries.

h2(#occupancy-presence). Occupancy and presence

The occupancy and presence features differ in the following ways:

- Occupancy := provides metrics about the clients attached to a channel. This includes a count of the number of clients attached, the number of publishers and subscribers, the number of presence members, and the number of presence publishers and subscribers.

- Presence := provides information about the activity of members entered into the presence set of a channel. Presence members announce their state to presence subscribers via presence events. For example, when entering the presence set, leaving the presence set, or updating their member data.
