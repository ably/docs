Before you can start using Ably's [push notification](/docs/push) services, you must configure the credentials for the third-party services you wish to integrate, such as FCM for Android devices, APNS for iOS devices, or Web Push for web browsers.

### Configure FCM for Android devices <a id="configure-FCM"/>

* Go to the [Firebase Console.](https://firebase.google.com/)
* Click **add project** and follow the steps to **create and manage service account keys**.
* Download your service account **JSON file**.
* In your Ably [dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any), navigate to the **Push Notifications** tab under your app settings.
* Go to **push notifications setup**, click **configure push**.
* Add your service account **JSON file** to the **setting up Firebase cloud messaging** section.

### Configure APNs for iOS devices <a id="configure-APNs"/>

* Go to the [Apple Developer Program.](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)
* Use the Apple developer portal to create a **push notification** service certificate for your app.
* Export the certificate as a **.p12 file**.
* Next, you can either import the **.p12 cert** or create a **PEM file** and copy it into your Ably dashboard:

* Import the **.p12 file**:
  * In your Ably [dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any), navigate to the **Push Notifications** tab under your app settings.
  * Go to **push notifications setup**, click **configure push** and scroll to the **setting up Apple push notification service** section.
  * Select the **.p12 file** you exported and enter the password you created during the export process.
  * Click **save**. You should receive confirmation that the certificate has been successfully imported.
  * To further confirm the import, refresh the page and check if the **PEM cert** and **private key** text boxes are now populated with the imported key details.
* Create a **PEM file** from the **.p12 file**:
  * Using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), convert the recently exported **.p12 file** (`io.ably.test.p12`) to a **PEM file** with the following command: `$ openssl pkcs12 -in ./io.ably.test.p12 -out ./io.ably.test.pem -nodes -clcerts`.
  * Open the **PEM file** in your text editor.
  * Copy everything between and including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`, and paste it into the **PEM cert** text box of the Apple push notification service section of your Ably notifications app [dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any).
  * Similarly, copy everything between and including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`, and paste it into the **PEM private key** text box of the same section. Then, click **Save**.

## Push inspector <a id="push-inspector"/>

The Push inspector tool enables you to manually send push notifications by specifying the required data and notification fields. This tool helps test and debug your notification setup before going live.

### API key <a id="api-key"/>

The [API Key](/docs/platform/account/app/configuration/api-keys) authenticates your requests when sending push notifications. Choose from the list of API keys associated with your Ably account. Each key has different permissions and scopes, so ensure you select the correct one for your notification tasks.

### Push notification title and body <a id="notification-content"/>

Create your push notification content:

1. Write a short, clear title that captures the essence of the notification.
2. Include the key information or message that you want the user to read.
3. Optionally, add any extra data needed for app functionality, such as custom metadata or instructions.

### Push notification target <a id="notification-target"/>

Choose how to target your push notification:

**To notify all subscribers of a channel:**
1. Enter the channel name in the target field.
2. Click **push to channel**.

**To target a specific device:**
1. Enter the Device ID in the target field.
2. Click **push to device**.

**To notify a specific client:**
1. Enter the Client ID in the target field.
2. Click **push to client**.

## Push inspector widget <a id="push-widget"/>

The Push Inspector widget allows you to monitor and manage your push notification infrastructure directly from the Ably dashboard. Use it to inspect and debug your notification setup:

**To inspect channel subscriptions:**
1. Navigate to the Channel subscriptions section.
2. Click **inspect channel** to see detailed information about a specific channel, including the number of subscribers and recent activity.

**To review device registrations:**
1. Navigate to the Device registrations section.
2. Click **inspect device** to view detailed information about a specific device, such as its registration status, platform, and recent notifications.

**To examine client registrations:**
1. Navigate to the Client registrations section.
2. Click **inspect client ID** to see detailed information about a specific client, including its subscriptions and recent activity.
