- Billable messages across delivery methods (realtime, REST, persisted, integrations, push notifications)
- Connection analytics (connection minutes, peak concurrent connections)
- Channel usage metrics (channel minutes, peak concurrent channels)
- Message type traffic breakdown (messages, presence events, objects, annotations)
- Cost optimization insights (delta bandwidth savings, batching/conflation savings)

### Usage breakdown <a id="usage-breakdown"/>

The detailed usage breakdown provides hourly data tables showing metrics such as messages, bandwidth, connections, channels, and push notifications. This data can be exported as a CSV file for further analysis.
