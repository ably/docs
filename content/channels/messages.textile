Messages contain the data that a client is communicating, such as the contents of a chat message. Clients publish messages on "channels":/channels, and these messages are received by clients that have "subscribed":/channels#subscribe to them. This pattern is otherwise known as pub/sub, as publishers and subscribers are completely decoupled.

<p>Messages are counted in 2KiB chunks. See "what counts as a message":https://faqs.ably.com/how-does-ably-count-messages. </p>

h2(#properties). Message properties

The following are the properties of a message:

- name := The name of the message.
- data := The contents of the message. Also known as the message payload.
- id := Each message sent through Ably is assigned a unique ID. Update this ID if you are using idempotent publishing.
- clientId := The "ID of the client":/auth/identified-clients that published the message.
- connectionId := The ID of the connection used to publish the message.
- timestamp := The timestamp of when the message was received by Ably, as milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
- extras := A JSON object of arbitrary key-value pairs that may contain metadata, and/or ancillary payloads. Valid payloads include those related to "Push Notifications":/general/push, "deltas":/channels/options/deltas and "message interactions":#interactions, and headers.
- encoding := This is typically empty, as all messages received from Ably are automatically decoded client-side using this value. However, if the message encoding cannot be processed, this attribute contains the remaining transformations not applied to the data payload.

h2(#interactions). Message interactions

Message interactions enable you to interact with previously sent messages and support a wide variety of use cases. You can decide and customize what data is included in an interaction, and how this is displayed to end-users.

Message interactions can help you to implement:

* Emoji reactions
* Message updates and deletion
* Read receipts and unread message counts
* Quoting and replying to messages
* Message threads
* Media previews

Once a channel has message interactions enabled, messages received on that channel will contain a unique @timeSerial@ that can be referenced by later messages.

Message interactions add a @ref@ object to message payloads that enables you to indicate what an interaction represents, and which message it is referring to. The @ref@ object contains two fields:

- @type@ (String) := a constant representing the reason for the interaction.
- @timeSerial@ (String) := a unique identifier used to reference a specific message, automatically generated when messages are sent in message interaction enabled channels.

<aside data-type='note'>
<p>If you want to limit the ability of users to use message interactions you can use "JWT authenticated user claims":/auth/capabilities#custom-restrictions.</p>

blang[default].
  Message interactions are only supported by the Ably JavaScript SDK.

blang[javascript,nodejs].
  Message interactions are only supported by the Ably JavaScript SDK.

  <!-- DASHBOARD-INSTRUCTION: Enable message interactions -->
  To enable message interactions for a channel:

  1. Login to your "Ably dashboard":https://ably.com/login.
  2. Select the app you are working with.
  3. Click *Settings* on the right side of the navigation bar.
  4. Scroll down to *Channel rules* and click *Add new rule*.
  5. Give your new rule a Namespace or provide a specific Channel ID.
  6. Select the *Message interactions enabled* checkbox then click *Create channel rule*.

  <a href="@content/realtime/message-interactions.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="@content/realtime/message-interactions.png" style="max-width:80%" alt="Message interactions in dashboard">
  </a>

  You now have a namespace based rule you can apply to channels to enable message interactions or a specific channel with message interactions enabled.

  h3(#use-interactions). Use message interactions

  Once message interactions have been enabled for a channel you can start to reference the @timeSerial@ of previous messages to publish interactions. All messages sent on channels that have interactions enabled will automatically include a @timeSerial@.

  To reference a previous message, include the @ref@ object inside the @extras@ object with:

  * A @type@ constant string defining the reason for interaction. Note that Ably has reserved strings beginning with @com.ably.@.
  * The @timeserial@ string of the message to interact with.

  The following is an example of sending an emoji reaction:

  ```[javascript]
  async function sendReaction(emoji) {
    await channel.publish({
      name: 'event_name',
      data: emoji,
      extras: {
        ref: {
          type: "com.ably.reaction",
          timeserial: "1656424960320-1"
        }
      }
    })
  }
  ```

  ```[nodejs]
  async function sendReaction(emoji) {
    await channel.publish({
      name: 'event_name',
      data: emoji,
      extras: {
        ref: {
          type: "com.ably.reaction",
          timeserial: "1656424960320-1"
        }
      }
    })
  }
  ```

  h3(#listener-interactions). Create a listener

  Regular listeners will get all messages (including those containing a reference), but it is possible to filter specifically for messages with or without a reference by supplying a filter object. A @filter object@ can contain any number of the following fields:

  - @refTimeserial@ (String) := filter containing a specific message timeserial (for example: @v1b25XrTDg:0@).
  - @refType@ (String) := filter for a specific reference type (for example: @com.ably.reaction@).
  - @isRef@ (Boolean) := filter for messages that only do or do not reference another message.

  h3(#subscribe-interactions). Subscribe to interactions

  Subscribing to interactions involves sending a filter object defining which interactions you're interested in.

  To subscribe to all reaction interactions:

  ```[realtime_javascript]
  await channel.subscribe({
    refType: "com.ably.reaction"
  }, onReaction);
  ```

  ```[realtime_nodejs]
  await channel.subscribe({
    refType: "com.ably.reaction"
  }, onReaction);
  ```

  To subscribe to any interaction:

  ```[realtime_javascript]
  await channel.subscribe({
    isRef: true
  }, onReference);
  ```

  ```[realtime_nodejs]
  await channel.subscribe({
    isRef: true
  }, onReference);
  ```

  To subscribe to any non-interaction:

  ```[realtime_javascript]
  await channel.subscribe({
    isRef: false
  }, onRegularMessage);
  ```

  ```[realtime_nodejs]
  await channel.subscribe({
    isRef: false
  }, onRegularMessage);
  ```

  To subscribe to interactions to a specific message:

  ```[realtime_javascript]
  await channel.subscribe({
    refTimeserial: 'v1b25XrTDg:0'
  }, onReference);
  ```

  ```[realtime_nodejs]
  await channel.subscribe({
    refTimeserial: 'v1b25XrTDg:0'
  }, onReference);
  ```

  To subscribe to a combination of filters:

  ```[realtime_javascript]
  await channel.subscribe({
    refTimeserial: 'v1b25XrTDg:0',
    refType: 'com.ably.reaction',
  }, onReference);
  ```

  ```[realtime_nodejs]
  await channel.subscribe({
    refTimeserial: 'v1b25XrTDg:0',
    refType: 'com.ably.reaction',
  }, onReference);
  ```

  h3(#unsubscribe-interactions). Unsubscribe from interactions

  Unsubscribing works similar to subscribing, you can unsubscribe by:

  * Passing the filter object to "@unsubscribe()@":/api/realtime-sdk/channels#unsubscribe and, or
  * Passing the filter function to "@unsubscribe()@":/api/realtime-sdk/channels#unsubscribe

  For example, to unsubscribe to reaction interactions:

  ```[realtime_javascript]
  channel.unsubscribe({
    refType: 'com.ably.reaction'
  });
  ```

  ```[realtime_nodejs]
  channel.unsubscribe({
    refType: 'com.ably.reaction'
  });
  ```

  Passing a filter object will unsubscribe every listener attached to that particular filter unless you also pass the filter function. Unsubscribing with a filter requires *exactly* the same filter object to be passed in.
