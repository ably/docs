Before you can start using Ably's [push notification](/docs/push) services, you must configure the credentials for the third-party services you wish to integrate, such as FCM for Android devices, APNS for iOS devices, or Web Push for web browsers.

### Configure FCM for Android devices <a id="configure-FCM"/>

To send push notifications to Android devices, add your Firebase service account credentials to Ably:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/).
2. Click "add project" and follow the steps to create and manage service account keys.
3. Download your service account JSON file.
4. In your Ably [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/push), navigate to the "Push Notifications" tab under your app settings.
5. Go to "push notifications setup", click "configure push".
6. Add your service account JSON file to the "setting up Firebase cloud messaging" section.

### Configure APNs for iOS devices <a id="configure-APNs"/>

To send push notifications to iOS devices, add your Apple push notification certificate to Ably:

1. Go to the [Apple Developer Program.](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)
2. Use the Apple developer portal to create a push notification service certificate for your app.
3. Export the certificate as a .p12 file.
4. Import the certificate into Ably using one of the following methods:

Import the .p12 file directly:

1. In your Ably [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/push), navigate to the "Push Notifications" tab under your app settings.
2. Go to "push notifications setup", click "configure push" and scroll to the "setting up Apple push notification service" section.
3. Select the .p12 file you exported and enter the password you created during the export process.
4. Click "save". You should receive confirmation that the certificate has been successfully imported.
5. To confirm the import, refresh the page and check if the "PEM cert" and "private key" text boxes are populated with the imported key details.

Alternatively, create a PEM file from the .p12 file:

1. Using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), convert the .p12 file (`io.ably.test.p12`) to a PEM file with the following command: `$ openssl pkcs12 -in ./io.ably.test.p12 -out ./io.ably.test.pem -nodes -clcerts`.
2. Open the PEM file in your text editor.
3. Copy everything between and including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`, and paste it into the "PEM cert" text box of the Apple push notification service section of your Ably [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/push).
4. Copy everything between and including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`, and paste it into the "PEM private key" text box of the same section. Then, click "Save".

## Push inspector <a id="push-inspector"/>

The Push inspector allows you to manually send push notifications to test and debug your notification setup.

### API key <a id="api-key"/>

The [API Key](/docs/platform/account/app/configuration/api-keys) authenticates your requests when sending push notifications. Choose from the list of API keys associated with your Ably account. Each key has different permissions and scopes, so ensure you select the correct one for your notification tasks.

### Push notification title and body <a id="notification-content"/>

Each push notification requires a title and body. You can also include extra data for app functionality:

1. Write a short, clear title that captures the essence of the notification.
2. Include the key information or message that you want the user to read.
3. Optionally, add any extra data needed for app functionality, such as custom metadata or instructions.

### Push notification target <a id="notification-target"/>

Push notifications can be sent to a channel, a specific device, or a specific client:

- Channel: enter the channel name in the target field and click "push to channel".
- Device: enter the Device ID in the target field and click "push to device".
- Client: enter the Client ID in the target field and click "push to client".

## Push inspector widget <a id="push-widget"/>

Use the Push inspector widget to monitor your push notification infrastructure. It provides inspection tools for channels, devices, and clients:

- Channel subscriptions: click "inspect channel" to view subscribers and recent activity.
- Device registrations: click "inspect device" to view registration status, platform, and recent notifications.
- Client registrations: click "inspect client ID" to view subscriptions and recent activity.
