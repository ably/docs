Ably supports two types of authentication schemes, "basic authentication":/auth/basic using a private API key, which should be used on servers (not on user devices), and "token authentication":/auth/token which should be by clients. With token authentication, your server generates short-lived tokens and passes them to clients that need to communicate with Ably. You can limit these tokens to specific capabilities (subscribe only, publish and subscribe) on named channels.

> *Note*:Ensure that you follow the principle of least privilege, by giving clients only the capabilities they need. 

To implement token authentication on the client, you must configure them using an @authUrl@ or @authCallback@ "client option":/api/realtime-sdk/types#client-options. The Ably Client Library SDK will use this to request a token for initial access and will automatically request a new token when the existing token expires.

This tutorial uses @authUrl@ is used in this tutorial, because the client is web-based and your cookies would be automatically sent to your server if it is on the same domain. You should use @authCallback@ on other platforms to give you more control over how this request is made to your servers.

<%= partial partial_version('tutorials/_step-1-create-app-and-api-key') %>

h2. Step 2 - Install Ably on your server

blang[java].
  To start using Ably in your JRE application, you need to include the Ably Client library. We recommend that you include the latest client library via Gradle in your project's @gradle.build@ file.

  ```[groovy]
    repositories {
      jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile 'io.ably:ably-java:1.2.0'
    }
  ```

  In the above example a specific version of the library is referenced, however we recommend you check which is the latest stable version and always use that. Follow link to get the latest stable release for "Java":https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ably/ably-java/latest.

  The server-client library must be instantiated with the private API key you copied in Step 1. This will ensure that the "basic authentication scheme":/auth/basic is used, which is almost always the right choice for your own trusted servers where the risk of compromise of your API key credentials is low.

  Add the following to a file named @Example.java@ to instantiate the Ably library inside your Node.js server:

  ```[java]
    private final static String API_KEY = "INSERT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE";

    private AblyRest ablyRest;

    public Example(){
        try {
          initAbly();
        } catch (AblyException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private void initAbly() throws AblyException{
        ablyRest = new AblyRest(API_KEY);
    }
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/token-auth-java-step2

blang[nodejs,android].
  To start using Ably on your Node.js server, you first need to install the NPM module. The NPM module can be installed as follows:

  ```[sh]
    npm install ably
  ```

  The server-client library must be instantiated with the private API key you copied in Step 1. This will ensure that the "basic authentication scheme":/auth/basic is used, which is almost always the right choice for your own trusted servers where the risk of compromise of your API key credentials is low.

  Add the following to a file named @server.js@ to instantiate the Ably library on your Node.js server:

  ```[nodejs]
    const Ably = require("ably");
    const rest = new Ably.Rest({ key: apiKey });
  ```

blang[android].
  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/token-auth-android-step2

blang[ruby].
  To start using Ably you first need to install the Ably RubyGem. The RubyGem can be installed as follows:

  ```[sh]
    gem install ably
  ```

  Or if using bundler, simply add the following to your @Gemfile@ and run @bundle install@:

  ```[ruby]
    gem 'ably'
  ```

  The server client library must be instantiated with the private API key you copied in Step 1. This will ensure that the "basic authentication scheme":/auth/basic is used, which is almost always the right choice for your own trusted servers where the risk of compromise of your API key credentials is low.

  As you do not need asynchronous access to the realtime API for this tutorial, you'll be using the simpler "REST client library":/api/rest-sdk.

  ```[ruby]
    require 'ably'
    ably = Ably::Rest.new(key: api_key)
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/token-auth-ruby-step2

blang[python].
  To start using Ably you first need to install The REST library for Python, it's "hosted on Github":https://github.com/ably/ably-python and is "published on PyPI":https://pypi.org/project/ably/ and can be installed as follows:

  ```[sh]
    pip install ably
  ```

  Then it can be imported and instantiated as follows:

  ```[python]
    from ably import AblyRest
    client = AblyRest(api_key)
  ```

  For the purpose of this tutorial, create a file called @server.py@ containing the code above. You'll be using this file later on.

  h4. Note on string encodings

  Since Ably supports both string and binary payloads, we recommend that strings passed to the library for publishing to Ably be unicode strings (e.g. event names or payload data). This is to avoid ambiguity regarding the type of payload. In Python 3 this is the normal string type, but in Python 2 it is not, so we suggest you prefix string literals with the @u@ prefix (eg @u'eventname'@ - or alternatively, use @from __future__ import unicode_literals@, which will make this automatic), and to explicitly decode any user input (e.g. @raw_input().decode(sys.stdin.encoding@).

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/token-auth-python-step2

blang[php].
  To start using Ably you first need to install the "composer package on packagist":https://packagist.org/packages/ably/ably-php into your composer.

  ```[sh]
    composer require ably/ably-php --update-no-dev
  ```

  The server-client library must be instantiated with the private API key you copied in Step 1. This will ensure that the "basic authentication scheme":/auth/basic is used, which is almost always the right choice for your own trusted servers where the risk of compromise of your API key credentials is low.

  Create a directory called @public@, which will serve as the document root. Add the following to a file named @ably.php@ to instantiate the Ably library inside your php script:

  ```[php]
    require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
    $ably = new \Ably\AblyRest("{{ApiKey}}");
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/token-auth-php-step2

blang[swift].
  For this Swift example, you need a web server to generate token requests. You will be using Ruby for the server in this tutorial. To start using Ably with Ruby, you first need to install the Ably RubyGem. The RubyGem can be installed as follows:

  ```[sh]
    gem install ably
  ```

  Or if using bundler, simply add the following to your @Gemfile@ and run @bundle install@:

  ```[ruby]
    gem 'ably'
  ```

  The server-client library must be instantiated with the private API key you copied in Step 1. This will ensure that the "basic authentication scheme":/auth/basic is used, which is almost always the right choice for your own trusted servers where the risk of compromise of your API key credentials is low.

  As you do not need asynchronous access to the realtime API for this tutorial, you'll be using the simpler "REST client library":/api/rest-sdk.

  ```[ruby]
    require 'ably'
    ably = Ably::Rest.new(key: api_key)
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/token-auth-swift-step2

h2. Step 3 - Set up your web server

Before a client connects to Ably, it will check if it has suitable credentials to authenticate with Ably. As you'll be using the recommended "token authentication scheme":/auth/token in the client for this demo, when the client starts up and attempts to connect to Ably, it will request a token immediately so that it can then authenticate with Ably.

As tokens are typically issued from your own web servers, you'll set up a simple web server now for this tutorial.

blang[java].
  "Spring Boot":https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/ is a very popular and simple web framework for Java. You'll need to get this set up:

  First you'll add following configuration to the @build.gradle@ file:

  ```[groovy]
    buildscript {
      repositories {
          jcenter()
          mavenCentral()
      }
      dependencies {
          classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:1.4.1.RELEASE")
      }
    }

    apply plugin: 'java'
    apply plugin: 'eclipse'
    apply plugin: 'idea'
    apply plugin: 'spring-boot'

    jar {
        baseName = 'gs-spring-boot'
        version =  '0.1.0'
    }

    repositories {
        ...
        mavenCentral()
    }

    sourceCompatibility = 1.8
    targetCompatibility = 1.8

    dependencies {
        compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web") {
            exclude module: "spring-boot-starter-tomcat"
        }
        compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-jetty")
        compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator")
        ...
    }
  ```

  Then you'll add an @Application.java@ class for initializing your web application.

  ```[java]
    import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
    import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
    import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

    @SpringBootApplication
    public class Application {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ApplicationContext ctx = SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
        }
    }
  ```

  Finally you need to add the following method to your @Example.java@ class:

  ```[java]
  @RestController
  public class Example {
      ...
      @RequestMapping(value = "/")
      public String index() {
          return "Hello, I am a very simple server";
      }
  }
  ```

  If you would like to try running the server now, you can do so with:

  ```[sh]
  gradle build && java -jar -Dserver.port=3000 build/libs/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar
  ```

  Once running, open your browser to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ and you should see the text "Hello, I am a very simple server".

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/token-auth-java-step3

blang[nodejs,android].
  This tutorial uses "Express.js":https://expressjs.com/ - a simple and popular web framework for Node.js. 

  First, install the @express@ NPM module and save it to your @package.json@ file:

  ```[nodejs]
  npm install --save express
  ```

  Then, set up a vanilla HTTP Express.js server in @server.js@:

  ```[nodejs]
    const express = require('express'),
          app = express();

    app.get('/', function (req, res) {
      res.send('Hello, I am a very simple server');
    });

    app.listen(3000, function () {
      console.log('Web server listening on port 3000');
    });
  ```

  Test that you server is running by executing @node server.js@ in the root of your project directory. Then, open your browser to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ and you should see the text "Hello, I am a very simple server".

blang[ruby].
  "Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ is a very simple and popular web server framework for Ruby. Rails is arguably more popular as a web server framework, however for the purposes of this tutorial it is overkill. Bear in mind that all the code in this tutorial can be used as is within Rails. You will need to configure routes in the @routes.rb@ file, add the code to a controller, and then add the HTML to a view.

  You'll need to get going with a simple Sinatra web server. Add the @sinatra@ RubyGem to your @Gemfile@ and then run @bundle install@:

  ```[ruby]
    gem 'sinatra'
  ```

  Now set up a vanilla Sinatra server in the @server.rb@ file:

  ```[ruby]
    require 'sinatra'
    get '/' do
      'Hello, I am a very simple server'
    end
  ```

  If you would like to try running the server now, you can do so with @bundle exec ruby server.rb@. Once running, open your browser to "http://localhost:4567/":http://localhost:4567/ and you should see the text "Hello, I am a very simple server".

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/token-auth-ruby-step3

blang[python].
  "web.py":https://webpy.org/ is a simple web framework for Python. Django is arguably more popular as a web server framework, however for the purposes of this tutorial it is overkill.

  You'll need to get going with a simple web.py web server. Install @web.py@ using @pip@:

  ```[sh]
    pip install web.py
  ```

  Now set up a vanilla web.py server in @server.py@:

  ```[python]
    import web

    class index:
        def GET(self):
            return 'Hello, I am a very simple server'


    urls = (
        '/', index
    )

    app = web.application(urls, globals())

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()
  ```

  In the @web.py@ file each resource is mapped to a class, which in turn takes action depending on the HTTP method used. In this case its main domain is @'/'@, which will be handled by the @index@ class, and will support HTTP @GET@.

  If you would like to try running the server now, you can do so with @python server.py@. Once running, open your browser to "http://localhost:8080/":http://localhost:8080/ and you should see the text "Hello, I am a very simple server". If you would like to change the port from which your site is available, simply add the port after the command (e.g. @python server.py 1234@ for port @1234@).

blang[php].
  PHP has a built-in web server functionality which allows it to serve php scripts, making it excellent for the purpose of this tutorial.

  Create the file @index.php@:

  ```[php]
    <?php
    echo "Hello, I am a very simple server";
  ```

  If you would like to try running the server now, you can do so with @php -S 0.0.0.0:8000@. Once running, open your browser to "http://localhost:8000/":http://localhost:8000/ and you should see the text "Hello, I am a very simple server".

h2. Step 4 - Respond to authentication requests

Before we move onto the client, you'll need to first make sure the web server is capable of issuing token requests to clients that need to authenticate with Ably. However, instead of jumping into code, let's quickly talk about how token authentication works and what the difference is between a "@Token@":/api/realtime-sdk/authentication#token-details and "@TokenRequest@":/api/realtime-sdk/authentication#token-request is.

When a client needs to authenticate, it will automatically send a request to the authentication URL you provide, which is normally a URL on your server. Alternatively, if you provide a callback instead of an authentication URL, it will invoke your callback and wait for it to respond with token details. See the "auth options documentation":/api/realtime-sdk/authentication#auth-options for more information on the options available.

Your web server or callback, following an authentication request, is then responsible for providing the client library with a "@Token@":/api/realtime-sdk/authentication#token-details or a "@TokenRequest@":/api/realtime-sdk/authentication#token-request. The token can contain permissions (we call them capabilities) and an identity for the client, but this functionality will be discussed later in this tutorial.

For now you need to understand how token requests and tokens differ and why in most cases we recommend you issue token requests as opposed to tokens.

h4. Tokens

All clients authenticating with Ably must use either an API key or a token. Tokens are obtained by sending a "@TokenRequest@":/api/realtime-sdk/authentication#token-request containing the required token spec to the Ably service.  The token may include a set of capabilities (permissions such as subscribe access to a specific channel), an identity (such as the logged-in user's unique ID) or a TTL (the time before the token expires).

h4. Token Requests

Token requests, unlike tokens, are created and signed by your server without having to communicate with Ably. A token request is simply a JSON object that contains a pre-authorization from your server for a client, effectively stating "Ably, with this signed token, I authorize you to issue a token according to the permissions, ID and TTL specified, to whoever hands this to you". Ably is then able to inspect the signature to ensure that the token request is indeed from your server and signed with your private API key. Ably will then issue a token to the client requesting the token. Ably ensures that token requests can only be used soon after creation and can only be used once.

Therefore, as it is possible to issue token requests without any communication with Ably (in the form of an HTTP request), we recommend that when a client needs to authenticate, you provide a signed token request. This approach minimizes the amount of work your server needs to do by distributing the task of obtaining a token from the Ably service using the token request to your clients instead.

In this step we will get the local web server ready to respond to authentication requests by issuing a token request to the requesting client.

blang[java].
  By adding the following route to the @Example.java@ class, it will be ready to service clients wanting to authenticate with Ably.

  ```[java]
    @RequestMapping("/auth")
    public String auth(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws AblyException {

      Auth.TokenParams tokenParams = new Auth.TokenParams(); /* Use token defaults for now */

      try {
        Auth.TokenRequest tokenRequest = ablyRest.auth.createTokenRequest(null, tokenParams);
        response.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
        return new Gson().toJson(tokenRequest);
      } catch (AblyException e) {
        response.setStatus(500);
        return "Error requesting token: " + e.getMessage();
      }
    }
  ```

  Try resetting your server again, then visit http://localhost:3000/auth to see a JSON token request in the form:

  ```[json]
  {
    "keyName": "I2ACJQ.Lv8AUQ",
    "ttl": 3600000,
    "timestamp": 1473894038255,
    "capability": "{\"*\":[\"*\"]}",

  By adding the following route to your Express.js server, it will be ready to service clients wanting to authenticate with Ably.

  ```[nodejs]

    app.get("/auth", (req, res) => {
      let tokenParams;
      // Check if the user is logged in
      if (req.cookies.username) {
        /* Issue a token with pub & sub privileges for all channels and
          configure the token with an client ID */
        tokenParams = {
          capability: { "*": ["publish", "subscribe"] },
          clientId: req.cookies.username,
        };
      } else {
        /* Issue a token request with sub privileges restricted to one channel
          and configure the token without a client ID (anonymous) */
        tokenParams = {
          capability: { notifications: ["subscribe"] },
        };
      }
  ```

  ```

  In the above example a specific version of the library is referenced, however we recommend you check which is the "latest stable version for Android":https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ably/ably-android/latest and always use that.

  After you add necessary dependencies, you can import the AblyRealtime class into your @ExampleActivity@ and initialize it.

  ```[java]
  public class ExampleActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_example);
        try {
            initAbly();
        } catch (AblyException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private void initAbly() throws AblyException {
        ClientOptions clientOptions = new ClientOptions();
        clientOptions.authCallback = new Auth.TokenCallback() {

            @Override
            public Object getTokenRequest(Auth.TokenParams tokenParams) throws AblyException {
                String httpAuthResponse = sendRequestToServer();
                tokenRequest = new Gson().fromJson(httpAuthResponse, Auth.TokenRequest.class);
                return tokenRequest;
            }
        };
        ablyRealtime = new AblyRealtime(clientOptions);
    }
  }
  ```

blang[java].
  Now you need to serve a static home page. You should delete the @index@ method in the @Example.java@ class, then open the @Application.java@ file and add following code:

  ```[java]
  import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
  ...
  @Configuration
  @SpringBootApplication
  public class Application extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {
  ...
      @Override
      public void addViewControllers(ViewControllerRegistry registry) {
          registry.addViewController("/").setViewName("forward:/index.html");
          super.addViewControllers(registry);
      }
  }
  ```

  Try restarting your server again and visit "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ to ensure the new static home page is being served up correctly. If you can see the static page, then it's time to instantiate the Ably client library SDK using token authentication.

blang[nodejs,android].
  Now you need to serve a static home page. Replace the @/@ route handler with the following:

  ```[nodejs]
    app.use('/', express.static(__dirname));
  ```

  Try running your server again with @node server.js@ and visit "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ to make sure that the new static home page is being served up correctly. If you can see the static page, then it's time to instantiate the Ably client library SDK using token authentication.

blang[ruby].
  Now you need to serve a static home page. Replace the code that responds to the @/@ route (look for @app.get('/', ...@) with the following:

  ```[ruby]
    get '/' do
      File.read('index.html')
    end
  ```

  Try running your server again with @bundle exec ruby server.rb@ and visit "http://localhost:4567/":http://localhost:4567/ to make sure the new static home page is being served up correctly. If you can see the static page, then it's time to instantiate the Ably client library SDK using token authentication.

blang[python].
  Now you need to serve a static home page. Replace the code that responds to the @/@ route (look for @index@ class) with the following:

  ```[python]
    class index:
        def GET(self):
            html = open('index.html')
            return html.read()
  ```

  Try running your server again with @python server.py@ and visit "http://localhost:8080/":http://localhost:8080/ to make sure the new static home page is being served up correctly. If you can see the static page, then it's time to instantiate the Ably client library SDK using token authentication.

  Try running your server again with @php -S 0.0.0.0:8000@ (if it's not up already) and visit "http://localhost:8000/":http://localhost:8000/ to make sure the new static home page is being served up correctly. If you can see the static page, then it's time to instantiate the Ably client library SDK using token authentication.

blang[android].
  Add the following into the @ExampleActivity#initAbly@ method:

  ```[java]
  ablyRealtime.connection.once(ConnectionState.connected, new ConnectionStateListener() {
            @Override
            public void onConnectionStateChanged(ConnectionStateChange state) {
                /* Always do UI updates on UI thread */
                runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
                    @Override
                    public void run() {
                        Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(),
                          "We're connected using the token request from the server /auth endpoint!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                    }
                });
            }
        });
  ```

blang[swift].
  By adding the following route to your server, it is now ready to service clients wanting to authenticate with Ably.

  ```[ruby]
    require 'json'

    # Issue token requests to clients sending a request to the /auth endpoint
    get '/auth' do
      content_type :json
      ably.auth.create_token_request.to_json
    end
  ```

  Try running your server again with @bundle exec ruby server.rb@ and visit "http://localhost:4567/auth":http://localhost:4567/auth to see a JSON token request in the form:

  ```[json]

  First, you'll need to set up an Xcode project that will serve as your client.

  To build your own Xcode Project in Swift visit the "Apple developer website":https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppStoreDistributionTutorial/Setup/Setup.html and get familiar with steps necessary to set up your own application.
  When you set up your application delete the default @ViewController.swift@, then add a new file by going through File -> New -> File... and choose @Cocoa Touch Class@.

  </a>

  After that navigate to @Main.storyboard@ in your project, click on the @ViewController@ that has already been added by default during the project creation. In the @Utilities@ that are located on the right select @Identity Inspector@. Find the field labeled "Class" and select "ExampleViewController".

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/token-auth-swift-step5b

  To start using Ably you first need to install the Ably pod via CocoaPods. You need to add a @Podfile@ to your project directory:

  bc[sh]. touch Podfile

  Then add this line to your application’s Podfile:

  ```[text]
    pod 'Ably'
  ```

  Install it with:

  bc[sh]. pod install

  To learn more about using CocoaPods in your project visit the "official CocoaPods guide":https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html.

  Inside any files which will be using Ably add the following import:

  ```[swift]
    import Ably
  ```

  Now it's time to instantiate the Ably client library SDK using token authentication.
  First, you need to create a new method that will try to connect us to Ably.
  By using @authCallback@ you don't have to worry if the user already has a clientId.

  ```[swift]
    private func connectToAbly() {

        let options = ARTClientOptions()

        options.authCallback = { params, callback in
            self.getTokenRequest() { json, error in
                do {
                    callback(try ARTTokenRequest.fromJson(json!), nil)
                  } catch let error as NSError {
                    callback(nil, error)
                    }
                  }
                }

        client = ARTRealtime(options: options)
        client.connection.on { state in
          if let state = state {
              switch state.current {
              case .Connected:
                  self.showAlert("Connected", message: "Successfully connected to API.")
              case .Failed:
                  print( self.client.connection.errorReason)
                  self.showAlert("Failed", message: "There was a problem connecting to API")
              default:
                  break
              }
            }
          }
    }
  ```

  Now add the @getTokenRequest@ method. This method is responsible for making a server request and obtaining a JSON response.

  ```[swift]
    func getTokenRequest(completion: (NSDictionary?, ErrorType?) -> ())  {
        let requestURL: NSURL = NSURL(string: "http://localhost:4567/auth")!
        let urlRequest: NSMutableURLRequest = NSMutableURLRequest(URL: requestURL)
        let session = NSURLSession.sharedSession()
        let task = session.dataTaskWithRequest(urlRequest) {
            (data, response, error) -> Void in
            let httpResponse = response as! NSHTTPURLResponse
            let statusCode = httpResponse.statusCode
            if (statusCode == 200) {
                do{
                    let json = try NSJSONSerialization
                    .JSONObjectWithData(data!, options:.AllowFragments) as! NSDictionary

                    completion(json, nil)
                  } catch {
                    self.showAlert("Error", message: "There was an error while obtaining JSON")
                  }
                }
              }
              task.resume()
      }
  ```

  Add this line to your @viewDidLoad@ method:

  ```[swift]
    connectToAbly()
  ```

  There is one more thing to do before you can test this code. By default Apple forces its developers to use secure connections, but the server in this tutorial is really simple and will be using HTTP. Because of that the code above won't work if you don't change the default behavior to allow arbitrary loads. In the @Project Navigator@ choose your project, then in the view that will appear click on your target. Next, click on the @Info@ tab and under "Custom iOS Target Properties" add a new row by right-clicking on the table and picking "Add Row". Type "App Transport Security Settings" then click on the @+@ type "Allow Arbitrary Loads" and change its value to "YES". If you have problems with these steps - see the image below:

  <a href="/images/tutorials/token-auth/tutorials-swift-info.plist.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/token-auth/tutorials-swift-info.plist.png" style="width: 100%" alt="info.plist">
  </a>

  Time for us to see what happens now. Execute the code in a simulator. You should receive an alert to confirm that you're connected to Ably which means your server has successfully issued a token request to the client. The client has then obtained a token from Ably with the token request, and then subsequently authenticated and finally connected.

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/token-auth-swift-step5b

Your client has now successfully connected to the Ably platform using token authentication. It will automatically request a new token when the existing one expires.

h2. Step 6 - Authenticate logged-in users

In the previous step you saw how easy it is to issue a token request from your server for clients that need to authenticate with Ably. However, the example is quite contrived in that it is unlikely you would want to issue tokens with a full set of capabilities to anonymous users. At present, the token issued allows all users to publish, subscribe, be present, retrieve stats and history across all channels.

blang[android].
  As the purpose of this tutorial is not to demonstrate how to build a complete authentication system for your production mobile app, you will implement a very basic (and clearly flawed) authentication system. You will issue subscribe-only tokens limited to a single channel for anonymous users, and issue publish and subscribe tokens for logged-in users.

  Now we need to enable the login and logout functionality in the web server. In order to keep this tutorial simple, when a user logs in we'll create a cookie, and when they log out we'll clear the cookie. Add the following routes to your @Example.java@ file.

  ```[java]
    @RequestMapping(value = "/login", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String login(@RequestParam(name = "username", defaultValue = "anonymous")
        String username, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {

  Now we need to enable the login and logout functionality in the web server. In order to keep this tutorial simple, you'll add a @username@ query parameter to the @/auth@ route. If it exists, it means user wants to log in, and if it doesn't they want to log out. Modify the @/auth@ route in you @server.js@ file.

  ```[nodejs]
    var tokenParams;
    if (req.query['username']) {
      tokenParams = {
        'capability': { '*': ['publish', 'subscribe'] },
        'clientId': req.cookies.username
      };
    } else {
      tokenParams = {
        'capability': { 'notifications': ['subscribe'] }
      };
    }
  ```

blang[ruby].
  Now we need to enable the login and logout functionality in the web server. In order to keep this tutorial simple, when a user logs in we'll set a cookie, and when they log out we'll clear the cookie.

  You'll need to add cookie support to Sinatra, so add the following to your @Gemfile@ and @bundle install@:

  ```[ruby]
    gem 'sinatra-contrib'
  ```

  Add the following routes to your @server.rb@ file.

  ```[ruby]
    require 'sinatra/cookies'

    # Set a cookie when the user logs in
    get '/login' do
      # Login the user without credentials.
      # This is an over simplified authentication system
      # to keep this tutorial simple
      if request.params['username']
        cookies[:username] = request.params['username']
        redirect to('/')
      else
        status 500
        'Username is required to login'
      end
    end

    # Clear the cookie when the user logs outs
    get '/logout' do
      cookies.delete 'username'
      redirect to('/')
    end
  ```

blang[python].
  Now we need to enable the login and logout functionality in the web server. In order to keep this tutorial simple, when a user logs in we'll set a cookie, and when they log out we'll clear the cookie.

  Add the following classes to your @server.py@ file.

  ```[python]
    # Set cookie when the user logs in
    class login:
        def GET(self):
            username = web.input().get('username')
            if username is not None:
                web.setcookie('username', username)
                raise web.seeother('/')
            else:
                raise web.InternalError('Username is required to login')

    # Clear the cookie when the user logs outs
    class logout:
        def GET(self):
            web.setcookie('username', None, -1)
            raise web.seeother('/')

    # update URLs
    urls = (
        '/', index,
        '/auth', auth,
        '/login', login,
        '/logout', logout
    )
  ```

blang[php].
  Now we need to enable the login and logout functionality in the web server. In order to keep this tutorial simple, when a user logs in we'll set a cookie, and when they log out we'll clear the cookie.

  You'll need to create two scripts that will serve as your login and logout functionality.

  First, create a @login.php@ file containing:

  ```[php]
    <?php
    if (isset($_REQUEST['username'])) {
      setcookie('username', $_REQUEST['username']);
      header('Location: /', true, 302);
    } else {
      http_response_code(500);
      echo "Username is required to login";
    }
  ```

  Secondly, create a @logout.php@ file to deal with logging out:

  ```[php]
    <?php
    setcookie('username', null, -1, '/');
    header('Location: /', true, 302);
  ```

blang[android].
  Let's add logged in and logged out states for our layout. To switch between them, you'll need to add logic into your @ExampleActivity@. Add the following inside your class:

  ```[java]
    private TextView tvCapabilities;
    private EditText etClientId;
    private SharedPreferences preferences;
    private boolean firstStart = true;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        ...
        preferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this);
        setUI();
        ...
    }

    private void setUI() {
        etClientId = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.etClientId);
        tvCapabilities = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tvCapabilities);
        findViewById(R.id.btLogin).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                new Thread(new Runnable() {
                    @Override
                    public void run() {
                        authenticate(etClientId.getEditableText().toString());
                    }
                }).start();
            }
        });
        findViewById(R.id.btLogout).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                new Thread(new Runnable() {
                    @Override
                    public void run() {
                        authenticate(null);
                    }
                }).start();
            }
        });
    }


    private void authenticate(String clientId) {
        final Auth.TokenParams params = new Auth.TokenParams();
        params.clientId = clientId;
        try {
            ablyRealtime.auth.requestToken(params, null);
        } catch (AblyException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private void initAbly() throws AblyException {
        ...
        clientOptions.authCallback = new Auth.TokenCallback() {

            @Override
            public Object getTokenRequest(Auth.TokenParams tokenParams) throws AblyException {
                if (firstStart) {
                    firstStart = false;
                    String clientId = preferences.getString("clientId", null);
                    if (clientId != null) {
                        tokenParams.clientId = tokenRequest.clientId;
                    }
                }
                String httpAuthResponse = sendRequestToServer(tokenParams.clientId);
                tokenRequest = new Gson().fromJson(httpAuthResponse, Auth.TokenRequest.class);
                preferences.edit().putString("clientId", httpAuthResponse).commit();
                setButtonsState();
                return tokenRequest;
            }
        };
        ...
    }

    private void setButtonsState() {
        runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                etClientId.setText(tokenRequest.clientId);
                tvCapabilities.setText(tokenRequest.capability);
                findViewById(R.id.btLogin).setVisibility(tokenRequest.clientId == null ? View.VISIBLE : View.GONE);
                findViewById(R.id.etClientId).setEnabled(tokenRequest.clientId == null);
                findViewById(R.id.btLogout).setVisibility(tokenRequest.clientId == null ? View.GONE : View.VISIBLE);
            }
        });
    }
  ```

  Remember that from your Android emulator, the localhost address is @10.0.2.2@. If you want to access your server from a physical device, just research setting up a @public IP address@.

      setAttribute('style', "display: " + (loggedIn ? 'block' : 'none'));
  ```

  Now that you have the means to determine if a user is logged in or logged out using the session cookie, you can issue restricted subscribe-only token requests for anonymous users and publish and subscribe token requests for logged in users. Replace the @Example#auth@ method body with the following:

  ```[java]
  String username = null;
  Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();
  for (Cookie cookie : cookies) {
      if (cookie.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("username")) {
          username = cookie.getValue();
          break;
      }
  }
  Auth.TokenParams tokenParams = new Auth.TokenParams();
  if (username == null) {
      tokenParams.capability = Capability.c14n("{ 'notifications': ['subscribe'] }");
  } else {
      tokenParams.capability = Capability.c14n("{ '*': ['publish', 'subscribe'] }");
      tokenParams.clientId = username;
  }
  Auth.TokenRequest tokenRequest = null;
  try {
      tokenRequest = ablyRest.auth.createTokenRequest(null, tokenParams);
      response.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
      return new Gson().toJson(tokenRequest);
  } catch (AblyException e) {
      response.setStatus(500);
      return "Error requesting token: " + e.getMessage();
  }
  ```

blang[nodejs].
  Now that you have the means to determine if a user is logged in or logged out using the session cookie, you can issue restricted subscribe-only token requests for anonymous users and publish and subscribe token requests for logged in users. Replace the @var tokenParams = {};@ code in your @server.js@ with the following:

  ```[nodejs]
    var tokenParams;
    /* Check if the user is logged in */
    if (req.cookies.username) {
      /* Issue a token request with pub & sub permissions on all channels +
         configure the token with an identity */
      tokenParams = {
        'capability': { '*': ['publish', 'subscribe'] },
        'clientId': req.cookies.username
      };
    } else {
      /* Issue a token with subscribe privileges restricted to one channel
         and configure the token without an identity (anonymous) */
      tokenParams = {
        'capability': { 'notifications': ['subscribe'] }
      };
    }
  ```

  Unfortunately Express.js is very lightweight and does not support cookie parsing out of the box. You need to add the @cookie-parser@ NPM module to Express.js. Add the following to your @package.json@ file:

  ```[json]
  {
    ...
    "dependencies": {
      "ably": ">=1.2",
      "express": "~4.0",
      "cookie-parser": "~1.4"
    }
  }
  ```

  And add the following to the top of your @server.js@ file, beneath the Express.js require, so that cookies are parsed:

  ```[nodejs]
    const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
    app.use(cookieParser());
  ```

blang[ruby].
  Now that you have a means to determine if a user is logged in or logged out using the session cookie, you can issue restricted subscribe-only token requests for anonymous users and publish and subscribe token requests for logged in users. Replace the @get '/auth' do ... end@ code in your @server.rb@ with the following:

  ```[ruby]
    require 'sinatra/cookies'

    # Allow cookies to be read in the browser
    set :cookie_options, httponly: false

    # Issue token requests to clients sending a request to the /auth endpoint
    get '/auth' do
      content_type :json

      # Check if the user is logged in
      token_params = if cookies[:username]
        # Issue a token request with pub & sub permissions on all channels +
        #   configure the token with an identity
        {
          capability: { '*' => ['publish', 'subscribe'] },
          client_id: cookies[:username]
        }
      else
        # Issue a token with subscribe privileges restricted to one channel
        #   and configure the token without an identity (anonymous)
        {
          capability: { 'notifications' => ['subscribe'] }
        }
      end
      ably.auth.create_token_request(token_params).to_json
    end
  ```

blang[python].
  Now that you have the means to determine if a user is logged in or logged out using the session cookie, you can issue restricted subscribe-only token requests for anonymous users and publish and subscribe token requests for logged in users. Replace the code for @auth@ class with the following:

  ```[python]
    class auth:
        def GET(self):
            username = web.cookies().get('username')
            if username is not None:
                token_params = {
                    'capability': {
                        '*': ['publish', 'subscribe']
                    },
                    'client_id': username
                }
            else:
                token_params = {
                    'capability': {
                        'notifications': ['subscribe']
                    }
                }
            web.header('Content-Type', 'application/json')
            return json.dumps(client.auth.create_token_request(token_params).to_dict())
  ```

blang[php].
  Now that you have the means to determine if a user is logged in or logged out using the session cookie, you can issue restricted subscribe-only token requests for anonymous users and publish and subscribe token requests for logged in users. Replace the code in your @auth.php@ with the following:

  ```[php]
    <?php
    require_once 'ably.php';
    // Check if the user is logged in
    if (isset($_COOKIE['username'])) {
      // Issue a token request with pub & sub permissions on all channels +
      // configure the token with an identity
      $tokenParams = [
        'capability' => [
          '*' => ['publish', 'subscribe']
        ],
        'clientId'  => $_COOKIE['username']
      ];
    } else {
      // Issue a token with subscribe privileges restricted to one channel
      // and configure the token without an identity (anonymous)
      $tokenParams = [
        'capability' => [
          'notifications' => ['subscribe']
        ]
      ];
    }
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    echo json_encode($ably->auth->createTokenRequest($tokenParams)->toArray());
  ```

blang[android].
  Finally, before you test this new functionality, update the Toast message so that it shows the authentication details after it connects to Ably. Replace the current Toast message with the following:

  ```[java]
    String user = ablyRealtime.auth.getTokenAuth().getTokenDetails().clientId;
    String capability = ablyRealtime.auth.getTokenAuth().getTokenDetails().capability;
    Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(), "You are now connected to Ably \n" +
                    "User: " + user + " \n" +
                    "Capabilities: " + capability, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
  ```

blang[nodejs,python,java,php,ruby].
  Finally, before you test this new functionality, update the alert so that it shows the authentication details after it connects to Ably. Replace @alert("We're connected...@ with the following:

  ```[javascript]
    var user = realtime.auth.tokenDetails.clientId || 'anonymous';
    var capability = realtime.auth.tokenDetails.capability;
    alert(
      'You are now connected to Ably \n' +
      'User: ' + user + ' \n' +
      'Capabilities: ' + capability
    );
  ```

blang[android].
  Ok, we're ready to see all of this in action. Restart the local server @node server.js@ and then rerun your application. You should receive a Toast message to confirm that you're connected as an anonymous user with limited capabilities as follows:

  Time to get started. We need to check if the user provided his username, and then based on that issue rights capabilities. Replace the @get '/auth' do ... end@ code in your @server.rb@ with the following:

  ```[ruby]
    # Issue token requests to clients sending a request to the /auth endpoint
    get '/auth' do
      content_type :json

      # Check if the user provided a login
      token_params = if params[:username]
        # Issue a token request with pub & sub permissions on all channels +
        #   configure the token with an identity
        {
          capability: { '*' => ['publish', 'subscribe'] },
          client_id: params[:username]
        }
        else
        # Issue a token with subscribe privileges restricted to one channel
        #   and configure the token without an identity (anonymous)
        {
          capability: { 'notifications' => ['subscribe'] }
        }
      end
        ably.auth.create_token_request(token_params).to_json
      end
  ```

  Now we will need to customize the client. If you have not previously had experience building a basic user interface in Xcode, please refer to the "Apple developer guide":https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/BuildABasicUI.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH5-SW1 on how to build a simple UI and also learn more about "adding @IBOutlets@ and @IBActions@":https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/ConnectTheUIToCode.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH22-SW1.

  First, add a login button and a textfield so that the user can provide their chosen username. Go to your @ExampleViewController@ and add a @UIButton@ from @Object library@. Name the action "loginAction".

  <a href="/images/tutorials/token-auth/tutorials-swift-binding-UI-token-auth.gif" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/token-auth/tutorials-swift-binding-UI-token-auth.gif" style="width: 100%" alt="Bind action">
  </a>

  In a similar fashion add one @UILabel@ and change its text to "Username:", then add @UITextField@ and connect it. Name it "usernameText".
  Your @ExampleViewController@ should look similar to this view:

  <a href="/images/tutorials/token-auth/tutorials-swift-token-auth-login-screen.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/token-auth/tutorials-swift-token-auth-login-screen.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Login view">
  </a>

  Now add another @ViewController@ form to @Object Library@. Create a new @Cocoa Touch Class@ named @LogoutViewController@ just like you did for @ExampleViewController@.

  In this view controller add one @UILabel@ with a message that the user is logged in. In addition, add a @UIButton@, but don't connect it to any @IBAction@.

  Your @LogoutViewController@ should look similar to this view:

  <a href="/images/tutorials/token-auth/tutorials-swift-token-auth-logout-screen.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/token-auth/tutorials-swift-token-auth-logout-screen.png" style="width: 60%" alt="Logout view">
  </a>

  To define the flow between the @ExampleViewController@ and the @LogoutViewController@ you will need to use segues. If you are not familiar with them, please refer to the "Apple developer guide":https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/UsingSegues.html on how they work.

  First, in your @Storyboard@, add a new "Present Modally" action segue. Name it "logoutSegue".

  <a href="/images/tutorials/token-auth/tutorials-swift-create-segue.gif" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/token-auth/tutorials-swift-create-segue.gif" style="width: 60%" alt="Create segue">
  </a>

  In your @ExampleViewController@ class add a method that will make our view controller perform the segue:

  ```[swift]
    private func performSegue() {
            self.performSegueWithIdentifier("logoutSegue", sender: self)
    }
  ```

  Now you need to change the action that is performed when the user clicks on "OK" when the alert is shown. Change this line:

  ```[swift]
    alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .Default, handler: nil)
  ```

  To this:

  ```[swift]
    alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .Default, handler: {action in
              if success {
                      self.performSegue()
                    } else {
                      return
                    }
                  }))
  ```

  Now you need to change the method that connects us to Ably. If the user doesn't provide their username then you shouldn't pass any parameters to your server. Equally when the textfield is filled you'll need to use its contents as the username.

  ```[swift]
    private func connectToAbly() {
      var requestURL = NSURL()

      let options = ARTClientOptions()
      if let clientId = usernameText.text where !clientId.isEmpty {
          requestURL = NSURL(string: "http://localhost:4567/auth?username=\(clientId)")!
        } else {
            requestURL = NSURL(string: "http://localhost:4567/auth")!
        }

        options.authCallback = { params, callback in
          self.getTokenRequest(requestURL) { json, error in
              do {
                  callback(try ARTTokenRequest.fromJson(json!), nil)
                } catch let error as NSError {
                  callback(nil, error)
                  }
              }
            }

        client = ARTRealtime(options: options)
        client.connection.on { state in
            if let state = state {
                switch state.current {
                  case .Connected:
                    self.updateSuccessState()
                    case .Failed:
                    print( client.connection.errorReason)
                    self.showAlert("Failed",
                    message: "There was a problem connecting to API", success: false)
                  default:
                      break
                  }
                }
            }
    }
  ```

  You also need to update the @getTokenRequest@ method so that it will use the correct URL request:

  ```[swift]
    func getTokenRequest(params: NSURL, completion: (NSDictionary?, ErrorType?) -> ())  {
      let requestURL: NSURL = params
      let urlRequest: NSMutableURLRequest = NSMutableURLRequest(URL: requestURL)
      let session = NSURLSession.sharedSession()
      let task = session.dataTaskWithRequest(urlRequest) {
          (data, response, error) -> Void in

          let httpResponse = response as! NSHTTPURLResponse
          let statusCode = httpResponse.statusCode

          if (statusCode == 200) {
              do{
                  let json = try NSJSONSerialization
                  .JSONObjectWithData(data!, options:.AllowFragments) as! NSDictionary

                  completion(json, nil)
                } catch {
                  self.showAlert("Error",
                                  message: "There was an error while obtaining JSON", success: false)
                }
              }
            }
            task.resume()
        }
  ```

  The method that configures the message that is shown on successful login looks like this:

  ```[swift]
    private func updateSuccessState() {
        var alertMessage = ""
        if let clientId = client.auth.clientId {
            alertMessage = "You are now connected to Ably \n
            User: \(clientId) \n Capabilities: {\"*\":[\"publish\",\"subscribe\"]}"
          } else {
            alertMessage = "You are now connected to Ably \n
            User: anonymous \n Capabilities: {\"notifications\":[\"subscribe\"]}"
        }
        self.showAlert("Connected", message: alertMessage, success: true)
      }
  ```

  The last thing you'll need to do is perform a logout action. You didn't connect the logout button to an action because you will need to connect it to a segue right now. In your @Storyboard@ hold ctrl and right-click the button and drag it to @ExampleViewController@ just like the earlier segue. Name it "toLoginSegue". When the user taps the logout button, before the segue is performed you'll need to close the connection to Ably and nullify the instance. All the actions that should be done before performing the segue can be done in the @prepareForSegue@ method in your @LogoutViewController@:

  ```[swift]
    override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject!) {
        if segue.identifier == "toLoginSegue" {
            client.connection.close()
            client = nil
          }
        }
  ```

  We're now ready to see all of this in action. Restart the local server @bundle exec ruby server.rb@ and then restart your simulation. Now when you tap on login you should receive an alert to confirm that you're connected as an anonymous user with limited capabilities as follows:
