title: Major livestream event pricing example
meta_description: "Calculate Ably Chat pricing for livestream events with high-concurrency chat. Example shows 25K concurrent viewers, message batching reducing costs by 95%, and total cost of ~$2,430 for a 1-hour major event."
meta_keywords: "livestream chat, high concurrency chat, message batching, chat pricing, realtime messaging, room reactions, chat moderation, event chat, scalable chat, Ably Chat pricing"
intro: "This Ably Chat example demonstrates consumption-based pricing for a major live event – thousands of viewers chatting simultaneously during a broadcast. Livestream chat involves high message velocity over a short duration, where batching is essential to manage costs at scale."

## Assumptions

The scale and features used in this calculation.

| Scale | Features |
|-------|----------|
| 1-hour event duration | ✓ Message batching (100ms window) |
| 100 messages per second | ✓ Moderation (100% of messages) |
| 360,000 messages sent = 900,000,000 delivered (with batching) | ✓ Room reactions |
| 10,000 room reactions = 70,000,000 delivered (with batching) | |
| 25,000 viewers × 1 hour = 1,500,000 connection minutes | |

<Aside data-type='note'>
Batching intervals are configurable from 50ms to 500ms. Lower intervals reduce latency; higher intervals increase batching efficiency.

## Cost summary

The high-level cost breakdown for this scenario. Messages are billed for both inbound (published to Ably) and outbound (delivered to subscribers) – a single message to 100 subscribers generates 101 billable messages.

| Item | Calculation | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Messages (with batching) | 900,000,000 × $2.50/M | $2,250 |
| Room reactions (with batching) | 70,000,000 × $2.50/M | $175 |
| Connection minutes | 1,500,000 mins × $1.00/M mins | $1.50 |
| Moderation (Ably) | 360,000 msgs × 1 rule invocation | $1.00 |
| Package fee |  | [See plans](/docs/platform/pricing) |
| **Total** |  | **$2,427.50/event** |

## Message breakdown

How the message cost breaks down by type. 

| Type | Inbound | Outbound | Total | Cost |
|------|---------|----------|-------|------|
| Chat messages | 360,000 | 900,000,000 | 900,360,000 | $2,250 |
| Room reactions | 10,000 | 70,000,000 | 70.010,000 | $175 |
| Moderation* | 360,000 | — | 360,000 | $1.00 |
| **Message costs** | **730,000** | **970,000,000** | **970,730,000** | **$2,426** |

Third-party moderation providers (Hive, Bodyguard, Tisane) are billed separately.

## Batching impact

How batching reduces costs at scale. Actual savings depend on your message patterns – bursty traffic batches more efficiently than steady streams.

| Scenario | Cost | Messages | Savings |
|----------|------|----------|---------|
| Without batching | $22,500 | 9,000,000,000 messages | — |
| With batching | $2,250 | 900,000,000 messages | **$20,250** |

## Room reactions calculation

10,000 room reactions to 25,000 viewers would generate 250,000,000 outbound messages unbatched.

With batching enabled and assuming 80% of reactions occur in bursts (during key moments), total outbound messages drop to 70,000,000:

- **Burst reactions (80%):** 8,000 reactions batched into ~800 deliveries × 25,000 viewers = 20,000,000 messages
- **Individual reactions (20%):** 2,000 × 25,000 viewers = 50,000,000 messages

**Total:** 70,000,000 messages × $2.50/M = **$175**
