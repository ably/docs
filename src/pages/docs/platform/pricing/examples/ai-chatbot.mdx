## Scenario

- **Chats:** 35,000 per month
- **Prompts per chat:** 4 (to reach resolution)
- **Tokens per response:** 300 token events
- **Agent stream rate:** 75 appends per second
- **Chat duration:** 3 minutes average

**Total cost: $109.50/month**

## Cost breakdown

The following breakdown shows the cost of connections, channels and messages in this scenario.

### How messages are counted

Every chat message counts as a billable message. Messages are counted when a user sends a prompt and when the agent delivers a response. Usage is billed in increments of one million messages, rounded up.

One user prompt sent to an agent = 2 messages (one sent to Ably + one delivered to the agent).

**How rollup reduces token messages**

Without rollup, each streamed token would be a separate message: 300 tokens = 300 messages per response. [Rollup batches tokens together](/docs/ai-transport/token-streaming/token-rate-limits#rollup), reducing this to 100 messages per response (a 66% saving). Because the append channel rule is required to use this pattern, persistence is automatically enabled and those messages are stored.

#### Messages generated by this scenario

| Message type           | Calculation                                                    | Messages   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| User prompts           | 35,000 chats × 4 prompts × (1 sent + 1 delivered)           | 280,000    |
| Agent responses        | 35,000 chats × 4 responses × 100 msgs × (1 sent + 1 delivered) | 28,000,000 |
| Persisted messages     | 14,140,000 inbound messages persisted                          | 14,140,000 |
| **Total messages**     | 280,000 + 28,000,000 + 14,140,000                              | **42,420,000** |
| **Total message cost** | **43,000,000 × $2.50/M**                                       | **$107.50** |

### How connection and channel minutes are counted

Both connection minutes and channel minutes are rounded up per million minutes used.

#### Connection minutes

[Connection minutes](/docs/platform/pricing#connections) are billed based on how long users remain connected.

| Item                        | Calculation                              | Total        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Connection minutes          | 35,000 chats × 3 mins × 2 (user + agent) | 210,000 mins |
| **Connection minutes cost** | **1,000,000 mins × $1.00/M**                    | **$1.00**    |

#### Channel minutes

[Channel minutes](/docs/platform/pricing#channels) are billed based on how long channels are active for.

| Item             | Calculation            | Total        |
|------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Channel minutes  | 35,000 chats × 3 mins  | 105,000 mins |
| **Channel cost** | **1,000,000 mins × $1.00/M**  | **$1.00**    |

### Total cost

The total monthly cost for 35,000 chats.

| Item               | Cost              |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Messages           | $107.50           |
| Connection minutes | $1.00             |
| Channel minutes    | $1.00             |
| **Total cost**     | **$109.50/month** |
