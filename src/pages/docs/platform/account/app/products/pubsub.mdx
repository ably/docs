The Pub/Sub section in your Ably dashboard provides a centralized hub for managing realtime messaging across your application. From this overview page, you can quickly access getting started guides for different platforms, explore ready-to-use examples, and review recent product updates through the changelog.

The dashboard makes it easy to jump into channel monitoring, review implementation patterns, and stay updated with the latest Pub/Sub features and fixes.

## Channels <a id="channels"/>

The channels interface serves as your primary dashboard for monitoring and managing all pub/sub messaging activity across your application. This section provides realtime visibility into channel performance, connection patterns, and message flow, enabling you to quickly identify issues and optimize your messaging implementation.

Navigate to the channels section through the dashboard sidebar under Products > Pub/Sub > Channels. The main channels view displays all active channels in a clean, searchable interface that makes it easy to monitor your entire messaging infrastructure at a glance.

### Channel browser functionality <a id="channel-browser"/>

The channel finder search box allows you to quickly locate specific channels by name - essential when managing applications with numerous channels across different features or namespaces. Simply enter a channel name or partial match to filter the results and find the channels you need to inspect.

The interface shows exactly how many channels are currently active with a counter display, giving you immediate awareness of your application's messaging scope and helping you track channel growth over time.

Each channel entry shows the **channel name** for identification, the **connection count** displaying realtime connected clients for monitoring traffic patterns, and an **inspect button** (eye icon) for accessing detailed monitoring and configuration.

The connection count column is particularly valuable for identifying channels experiencing high traffic, unusual activity patterns, or potential connection issues. Channels with unexpectedly high or low connection counts can indicate performance problems, client-side issues, or changes in user behavior that need investigation.

## Channel inspection <a id="inspection"/>

When you click the inspect button (eye icon) next to any channel in the channels list, you access a comprehensive channel monitoring interface that provides deep visibility into that specific channel's behavior, performance, and configuration.

### Channel inspection overview <a id="inspection-overview"/>

The inspection page opens with a detailed overview showing critical channel information and realtime metrics. The header displays the full channel name with a copy button for easy reference, along with breadcrumb navigation back to the main channels list.

#### Live analytics and visualization

The inspection interface provides two primary analytics sections with live, updating charts that help you understand channel behavior over time.

##### Messages analytics

The messages chart displays realtime inbound and outbound message flow with color-coded tracking for different message types. Use this to identify message patterns and delivery bottlenecks.

##### Occupancy analytics

The occupancy chart tracks connections, publishers, subscribers, and presence members over time. Use this data to understand user engagement patterns and optimize your messaging architecture.

#### Channel configuration and rules

The rules section provides comprehensive configuration options for controlling channel behavior and security requirements. Configure **Storage rules** to control message persistence and history retention, **Channel rules** to enforce security requirements like identification and TLS, and **Feature rules** to enable advanced capabilities such as push notifications and message annotations.

#### Integrations

The integrations section allows you to connect channels to external services and configure automated workflows triggered by channel activity.

Use the **Add integration** button to set up new external connections.

#### Live logs and debugging

The live logs section provides essential debugging capabilities through realtime event monitoring and error tracking.

Live logs track **API requests** for monitoring REST API calls and authentication, **Channels** for creation and configuration changes, **Connections** for client state changes, and **Integration errors** for webhook failures and external service issues.

When the logs show no entries, this indicates normal channel operation without errors or notable events. During active debugging or high-traffic periods, you'll see realtime event streams that help diagnose issues and verify system behavior.

## Connections <a id="connections"/>

The connections tab provides detailed visibility into all clients currently connected to your channel, enabling you to monitor individual connection behavior and troubleshoot client-specific issues.

### Connection overview <a id="connection-overview"/>

When you select the connections tab from the channel inspection interface, you'll see a comprehensive list of all active connections to that specific channel. The interface displays key connection information in an organized table format.

Each connection shows its unique connection ID, client ID (if set), geographic location, and SDK version. The connection list displays the total number of active connections, with an inspect button (eye icon) for detailed analysis of each connection.

### Individual connection inspection <a id="individual-connection"/>

When you click the inspect button on any connection, you access a detailed connection monitoring interface that provides comprehensive information about that specific client's behavior and configuration.

#### Overview

The overview tab displays essential connection information including client ID, transport type (WebSocket/HTTP), connection timestamp, current status, IP address with geographic location, SDK version, and platform details.

#### Authentication

The authentication section shows the security configuration including authentication method (Basic/Token), security protocol (TLS), and the API key ID used for authentication.

#### Capabilities

The capabilities section displays what features this client supports, shown as capability strings that indicate which Ably features the client can use.

#### Activity

The activity section provides realtime metrics showing inbound and outbound message rates. The activity chart visualizes message flow over time, helping you identify usage patterns and potential issues for individual connections.

#### Live logs

The live logs section shows realtime events specific to this connection including timestamps, resource IDs, event types (connection.error, connection.attached), and severity levels. This connection-specific logging helps troubleshoot individual client issues and verify expected behavior.

## Messages <a id="messages"/>

The messages tab provides access to all messages flowing through your channel, enabling you to inspect message content and debug messaging issues in realtime.

### Message browser interface <a id="message-browser"/>

The message browser displays all messages with a **Message finder** search box for filtering by content, **API Key status** indicator, **Message counter** showing total activity volume, and a **Detach option** to control live streaming.

### Message list details <a id="message-list"/>

Each message entry shows the message ID, source connection ID (or N/A for REST API messages), message name/event type, data payload preview, timestamp, and a message button to view full JSON details.

### JSON message inspection <a id="json-message"/>

Click on any message to view the complete JSON structure in the right panel. The JSON view organizes information into categories including message identifiers, action types, data payloads, and timestamps. It provides syntax highlighting and expandable structures for debugging message format, verifying data integrity, and understanding the complete message structure.

## Presence <a id="presence"/>

The presence tab allows you to monitor client presence activity on your channel, tracking when clients enter, leave, or update their status.

### Presence interface <a id="presence-interface"/>

The presence browser displays presence events with a search box for filtering, API key status indicator, presence event counter, and a detach option to stop live monitoring.

### Presence event details <a id="presence-events"/>

Each presence event shows the client ID, action type (enter/leave/update), presence data payload, timestamp, and an event button to view full JSON details.

### JSON presence inspection <a id="json-presence"/>

Click on any presence event to view the complete JSON structure in the right panel. The JSON view organizes information into categories including client identifiers, action types, data payloads, and timestamps. It provides syntax highlighting and expandable structures for debugging presence data format and understanding the complete event structure.

When the interface shows no presence events, this indicates no recent presence activity. This is normal for channels where clients connect for messaging without requiring presence tracking.

## Clients <a id="clients"/>

### Web client <a id="web-client"/>

The [web client](/docs/platform/account/app/client) provides a browser-based interface for testing and debugging your pub/sub implementation without writing code. Use it to publish messages, subscribe to channels, and verify your application behavior during development.

### CLI <a id="cli"/>

The [Ably CLI](/docs/platform/tools/cli) offers command-line tools for managing pub/sub operations, testing channels, and automating messaging workflows. Use it for scripting, CI/CD integration, and server-side debugging.
