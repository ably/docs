h5(#pricing-push). Push Technology

Push Technology takes a different approach: a limited self-hosted version and a cloud version.

Both platforms charge roughly ~$1 per million messages sent outside of your agreed limits.

To better understand the pricing models and what you get let’s look at some examples.

*Example one*

A chat application with 100,000 users/month, each averaging two ten-minute chat sessions with 20 messages averaging 1KB in payload in each direction between customer and operator. The application has around 3,000 concurrent users at any one time.

For Realtime.co, the app would result in the following:

* 20 messages * 2 sessions * 100,000 messages = 4,000,000 messages
* Total cost = *$30*

This would be covered under the $30/month plan as it can take 3,000 concurrent users and 31 million messages a month.

For Push Technology, the app would result in the following:

* 20 messages * 2 sessions * 100,000 messages = 4,000,000 messages * 1kb data = 4GiB
* cost of data = 4GiB * $1 = $4
* Total cost = $75 + $4 = *$79*

3,000 concurrent users would be covered on the $75/month plan but data for messages would be charged extra.

*Example two*

This one’s an app where you can hail cabs with your smartphone. When you request a ride the backend checks which drivers are online by using the `here_now()` call. Online drivers are alerted and accept a trip. Once matched, the driver’s location is published twice per minute to the user. An average ride lasts 15 minutes. There’s an average 100 concurrent connections and 30 rides a day.

For Realtime.co, this would result in the following:

* 100 concurrent connections
* 30 messages publishing and receiving latitude/longitude from driver to rider = 31 messages * 30 rides = 910 messages per day * 30 = 27,300 messages per month
* Total cost = *$30*

For Push Technology, this would result in the following:

* 100 concurrent connections
* 30 messages publishing and receiving latitude/longitude from driver to rider = 31 messages * 30 rides = 910 messages per day * 30 = 27,300 messages per month at average of 1KiB / message = 0.0273 GiB
* Total cost = $35 + $0.013718593 =  *$35.013718593*.

_Note that for Push Technology this would actually be covered under the free plan._
