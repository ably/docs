JWTs may specify publish rate limits for a user on particular channels. These limits can be used to prevent any individual user from sending an excessive number of messages in a short period of time.

An example use case is in a large live chat where you may wish to limit users to posting messages no more than once every 10 seconds.

Rate limits can be scoped to individual channels or to "channel namespaces":/channels#namespaces. Note that the rate limit with the most specific scope will be applied to the user.

To set rate limits for individual connections, include @ably.limits.publish.perAttachment.maxRate.<resource-name>@ in your JWT authentication payload. The value of this property sets how many messages can be published per second to a channel, or namespace. For example, a value of @5@ restricts the rate to 5 messages per second. A value of @0.1@ restricts the rate to 1 message every 10 seconds.

The following is an example of setting different rate limits for different channels:

```[javascript]
const claims = {
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "x-ably-capability": <...>,
  "x-ably-clientId": <...>,
  "ably.limits.publish.perAttachment.maxRate.chat1": 10, // the user can publish 10 messages per second in channel chat1
  "ably.limits.publish.perAttachment.maxRate.chat:*": 0.1 // the user can publish a message every 10 seconds in all channels within the chat namespace
}
```
