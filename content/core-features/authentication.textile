Both the "REST client library":/rest/authentication and the "Realtime client library":/realtime/authentication use common authentication mechanisms. The two schemes supported by Ably are "basic authentication":#basic-authentication, which uses your Ably "API key":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key, and "token authentication":#token-authentication, which uses short-lived tokens for access. These tokens are periodically renewed, and can be "revoked":#token-revocation if required.

**Important:** Token authentication is the recommended authentication mechanism on the client-side, as it provides more fine-grained access control and limits the risk of exposing your Ably API key. In production systems you should never use basic authentication on the client-side as it exposes your Ably API key. API keys don't have an expiry, so once compromised, they could be used indefinitely by an attacker. Tokens have an expiry, and so there is only a small period of time during which the compromised token can be used. It is also possible to "revoke tokens":#token-revocation, should that be necessary for security reasons.

**Important:** You should never use token authentication server-side as this results in unnecessary overhead - the server would periodically require token requests to authenticate. For server-side, basic authentication is the recommended approach.

In summary, on the client-side use token authentication. On the server-side use basic authentication.

h3(#tutorials). Tutorials &amp; Examples

If you would like to just dive in and see an example of Ably authentication in code, then take a look at our "client-server authentication tutorials":/tutorials.

h2(#basic-authentication). Basic authentication

Every application has one or more private API keys that you set up and "configure via the dashboard":https://faqs.ably.com/setting-up-and-managing-api-keys. These keys can be used to authenticate with Ably. It is recommended that private API keys are never shared with untrusted parties, and as such, should only be used by your trusted secure servers when authenticating with Ably.

Basic authentication is the simplest way to authenticate with Ably. It is as simple as:

bc[javascript](code-editor:authentication/basic-auth). var ably = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}' });

h3. Process used by client libraries connecting with basic auth:

<a href="/images/diagrams/Ably-API-Auth1.gif" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/diagrams/Ably-API-Auth1.gif" style="width: 100%" alt="Basic authentication process diagram">
</a>

While basic authentication is simple, Ably recommends that it is only used server-side because of the following potential issues:

* The secret is passed directly by the client to Ably, so it is not permitted for connections that are not over TLS (HTTPS or non-encrypted realtime connections) to prevent the key secret being intercepted.
* All of the configured capabilities of the key are implicitly possible in any request, and clients that legitimately obtain this key may then abuse the rights for that key.
* A client that authenticates using an API key can claim any client ID it chooses. Therefore this client ID cannot be trusted to represent the genuine identity of the client.

h2(#token-authentication). Token authentication

Client-side devices should generally be considered untrusted, and as such, it is important that you minimize the impact of any credentials being compromised on those devices. Token authentication achieves this by having a trusted device, such as one of your own servers, possessing an API key "configured via the dashboard":https://faqs.ably.com/setting-up-and-managing-api-keys. It can then use the API key to distribute time-limited "tokens":#tokens with limited sets of "access rights or capabilities":#capabilities-explained, or with "specific identities (<span lang="default">@clientId@</span><span lang="csharp">@ClientId@</span>)":#identified-clients to untrusted clients.

Different token-issuing mechanisms can be used with Ably; the default is to use "Ably Tokens":#tokens which you request from Ably based on an Ably "TokenRequest":/realtime/authentication#token-request that you sign and issue from your servers to clients; or a "JSON Web Token":https://jwt.io (JWT) which you generate on your servers and sign using your private API key. Token authentication, in most cases, is the recommended strategy on the client-side as it provides more fine-grained access control and limits the risk of exposed credentials being compromised.

Any of the following will cause the library to use token authentication:

* an "<span lang="default">@authUrl@</span><span lang="csharp">@AuthUrl@</span>":/realtime/types#client-options or "<span lang="default">@authCallback@</span><span lang="csharp">@AuthCallback@</span>":/realtime/types#client-options is provided that returns an Ably-compatible token or an Ably "@TokenRequest@;":/realtime/types#token-request
* "<span lang="default">@useTokenAuth@</span><span lang="csharp">@UseTokenAuth@</span>":/realtime/types#client-options is true;
* a "<span lang="default">@clientId@</span><span lang="csharp">@ClientId@</span>":/realtime/types#client-options is provided (only for pre-1.1 client libraries);
* a "<span lang="default">@token@</span><span lang="csharp">@Token@</span>":/realtime/types#client-options or "<span lang="default">@tokenDetails@</span><span lang="csharp">@TokenDetails@</span>":/realtime/types#client-options property is provided

The last of those (providing a literal <span lang="default">@token@</span><span lang="csharp">@Token@</span> or <span lang="default">@tokenDetails@</span><span lang="csharp">@TokenDetails@</span>) is mostly only used for testing: since tokens are short-lived, in production you almost always want to use an authentication method that allows the client library to renew the token automatically when the previous one expires.

Please note that when setting up a mechanism to automatically renew tokens, an @authURL@ might be more relevant and recommended to be used with the web based clients as they can easily utilize cookies and other web-only features. However, in case of non-web clients, @authCallback@ is the recommended strategy.

Token authentication is typically done in one of four ways:

h3(#token-request-process). Ably TokenRequest is created by your servers and passed to clients

p(tip#timetip). Token requests include a timestamp. So you should ensure that the machine on which you are running your auth server has an accurate clock, for example, by using an "NTP daemon":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntpd. If you are not able to control your machine's clock, you may wish to use the "@queryTime@ auth option":/rest/types#auth-options to avoid "'Timestamp not current' errors":https://faqs.ably.com/40104-timestamp-not-current.

Using an Ably Client Library SDK, a @TokenRequest@ is "generated from your server":/realtime/authentication#create-token-request and returned to the client-side SDK instance. The client-side SDK instance then uses the "@TokenRequest@":/realtime/types#token-request to request an "Ably Token":/realtime/authentication#request-token from Ably, and subsequently authenticates using that "Ably Token":#ably-tokens. This is the recommended approach for authentication as: an Ably "@TokenRequest@":/realtime/types#token-request can be generated securely by your servers without communicating with Ably; your secret API key is never shared with Ably or your clients; Ably "TokenRequests":/realtime/types#token-request cannot be tampered with due to being signed, must be used soon after creation and can only be used once.

<a href="/images/diagrams/Ably-token-auth-1.gif" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/diagrams/Ably-token-auth-1.gif" style="width: 100%" alt="Ably TokenRequest auth process diagram">
</a>

The following is an example of creating an Ably @TokenRequest@:

bc[javascript](code-editor:authentication/create-token-request). var ably = new Ably.Rest({ key: '{{API_KEY}}' });
ably.auth.createTokenRequest({ clientId: 'client@example.com' }, null, function(err, tokenRequest) {
  /* tokenRequest => {
       "capability": "{\"*\":[\"*\"]}",
       "clientId": "client@example.com",
       "keyName": "{{API_KEY_NAME}}",
       "nonce": "5576521221082658",
       "timestamp": {{MS_SINCE_EPOCH}},
       "mac": "GZRgXssZDCegRV....EXAMPLE"
     } */
});

Clients can pass this server-side generated @tokenRequest@ to Ably to authenticate with Ably automatically. 

You can alternatively specify an authentication callback function when you create the Ably client. Inside @authCallback@, you can make the network request to your servers to generate the @tokenRequest@. For example:

bc[javascript](code-editor:authentication/auth-callback). const ablyClient = new Realtime({
    authCallback: async (tokenParams, callback) => {
        try {
            const tokenRequest = await createTokenRequest() // Make a network request to your server
            callback(null, tokenRequest)
        } catch (error) {
            callback(error, null)
        }
    }
});

The @tokenParams@ argument in @authCallback@ is available for convenience, allowing you to see the capabilities, @clientId@, and other details requested by the client. However, @tokenParams@ should not be trusted or used to generate the @tokenRequest@ on the server side. Instead, it is recommended that your @createTokenRequest@ API authenticates clients separately: for example, based on cookies, headers, or HTTP body.

h3(#token-process). Ably Token is issued by your servers and passed to clients.

Using an Ably Client Library SDK, an "Ably Token is requested by your servers":/realtime/authentication#request-token from Ably and then passed to the client-side SDK instance. The client-side SDK instance then uses that "Ably Token":#tokens to authenticate with Ably. This is an alternative approach for authentication that enables you to issue "Ably Tokens":#tokens directly as opposed to providing Ably "TokenRequests":/realtime/types#token-request from your servers. The advantage for clients is it saves one round trip request as they do not need to request an "Ably Token":#tokens themselves. The disadvantage is that your servers must communicate with Ably each time an "Ably Token":#tokens is required.

<a href="/images/diagrams/Ably-Auth-Overview1.gif" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/diagrams/Ably-Auth-Overview1.gif" style="width: 100%" alt="Ably token auth process diagram">
</a>

The following is an example of issuing an Ably Token:

bc[javascript](code-editor:authentication/request-token). var ably = new Ably.Rest({ key: '{{API_KEY}}' });
ably.requestToken({ clientId: 'client@example.com' }, function(err, token) {
  /* token => {
       "token": "xVLyHw.Dtxd9tuz....EXAMPLE",
       "capability": "{\"*\":[\"*\"]}"
       "clientId": "client@example.com",
       "expires": 1449745287315,
       "keyName": "{{API_KEY_NAME}}",
       "issued": 1449741687315,
     } */
});

h3(#ably-jwt-process). Ably JWT is created by your servers and passed to clients

p(tip). In most scenarios, we would recommend you use one of the many "JWT libraries available":https://jwt.io/ when constructing your JWT.

It is possible to use a "JWT":https://jwt.io as a form of token for authentication with Ably, so long as it is structured appropriately, in what will be referred to as an "*Ably JWT*":#ably-jwt. It is possible for an "Ably JWT":/core-features/authentication#ably-jwt to contain claims indicating its clientId, capabilities and expiry - in an analogous way to an "Ably Token":#tokens - and it is signed with the applicable "Ably API key's secret part":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key.

This is similar to signing an Ably "@TokenRequest@":/realtime/authentication#request-token, but the client does not need then to request an "Ably Token":#ably-tokens, instead being able to use the "Ably JWT":/core-features/authentication#ably-jwt as a token in itself. "Any compliant third-party JWT library":https://jwt.io/ may be used to create the JWT without requiring the token to be issued by Ably. This can be useful for situations where an Ably client library is not available, such as an embedded device connecting to Ably via "MQTT":/mqtt.

Similarly to with the "TokenRequest flow":#timetip , you should ensure that your auth server has an accurate clock, as the JWT includes absolute "issued at" and "expires at" timestamps.

An example of creating an "Ably JWT":/core-features/authentication#ably-jwt manually can be seen below, with *SECRET* being the "secret part of your API key":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key. In most scenarios however, we would recommend you use one of the many "JWT libraries available for simplicity":https://jwt.io/:

<a href="/images/diagrams/Ably-Auth-Overview2.gif" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/diagrams/Ably-Auth-Overview2.gif" style="width: 100%" alt="Ably JWT auth method">
</a>

The following is an example of creating an Ably JWT:

```[javascript](code-editor:authentication/jwt-token)
  var header = {
    "typ":"JWT",
    "alg":"HS256",
    "kid": "{{API_KEY_NAME}}"
  }
  var currentTime = Math.round(Date.now()/1000);
  var claims = {
    "iat": currentTime, /* current time in seconds */
    "exp": currentTime + 3600, /* time of expiration in seconds */
    "x-ably-capability": "{\"*\":[\"*\"]}"
  }
  var base64Header = btoa(header);
  var base64Claims = btoa(claims);
  /* Apply the hash specified in the header */
  var signature = hash((base64Header + "." + base64Claims), "{{API_KEY_SECRET}}");
  var ablyJwt = base64Header + "." + base64Claims + "." + signature;
```

*Note:* At present Ably does not support asymmetric signatures based on a keypair belonging to a third party. If this is something you'd be interested in, please "get in touch":https://ably.com/contact.

h4(#jwt-embed-process). Ably-compatible token is embedded in a External JWT from your server and passed to clients

If a system has an existing "JWT":https://jwt.io/ scheme, it can be useful to embed an Ably-compatible token as a claim within it. The External JWT and embedded Ably-compatible token need to meet the following requirements:

* The embedded token is an "Ably JWT":#ably-jwt-process, or an "Ably Token":#ably-tokens
* The embedded token is included under the @x-ably-token@ key in the "JOSE Header":https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519
* OR (if using JWS) the embedded token is included using the @x-ably-token@ Claim in the payload
* The expiry time of the embedded token must not be earlier than the outer JWT’s expiry time (@exp@ Claim). Ably will reject any JWT if it is unencrypted and its @exp@ Claim is later than the expiry of the enclosed token. This helps to ensure that tokens are renewed prior to expiry

<a href="/images/diagrams/Ably-Auth-Overview3.gif" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/diagrams/Ably-Auth-Overview3.gif" style="width: 100%" alt="Token embedded in a JWT auth method">
</a>

The following is an example of issuing an Ably-compatible token inside the of header of a JWT:

bc[javascript]. var ably = new Ably.Rest({ key: '{{API_KEY}}' });
ably.auth.requestToken({ clientId: 'client@example.com' }, function(err, tokenDetails) {
  var header = {
    "typ":"JWT",
    "alg":"HS256",
    "x-ably-token": tokenDetails.token
  }
  var claims = {
    "exp": currentTime + 3600
  }
  var base64Header = btoa(header);
  var base64Claims = btoa(claims);
  /* Apply the hash specified in the header */
  var signature = hash((base64Header + "." + base64Claims), SECRET);
  var jwt = base64Header + "." + base64Claims + "." + signature;
  /* Send jwt to client */
});

*Note:* The authenticity of the JWT *will not* be checked, due to Ably not having access to your SECRET key.

h2(#selecting-auth). Selecting an authentication mechanism

<%= partial partial_version('core-features/_authentication_comparison') %>

h2(#capabilities-explained). Capabilities and Token Security explained

"API keys":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key, like "Ably-compatible tokens":#tokens, have a set of capabilities assigned to them that specify which "operations":#capability-operations (such as subscribe or publish) can be performed on which channels. However, unlike tokens, API keys are long-lived, secret and typically not shared with un-trusted clients.

API keys and their capabilities are "configured using the dashboard":https://faqs.ably.com/setting-up-and-managing-api-keys, or "using the Control API":/control-api. Ably-compatible tokens are designed to be shared with un-trusted clients, are short-lived, and can be configured and issued programmatically. See "selecting an authentication scheme":#selecting-auth to understand why token authentication is the preferred authentication scheme in many cases.

h3(#capabilities-key). Capabilities with API keys

An "Ably API key":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key can have single set of permissions, applied to any number of channels or "queues":/general/queues. To create a key with certain permissions, simply go to create a new API key and "select the desired permissions":https://faqs.ably.com/setting-up-and-managing-api-keys.

You can also choose whether to restrict the API key to only channels, only "queues":/general/queues, or to match a set of channel/queue names. If you've chosen to restrict the API key to *selected channels and queues*, you can use a comma separated list of resources the API key can access, making use of "wildcards":#wildcards to provide access to areas of your app. It is worth noting an API key will provide the same permissions to all resources it has access to.

h3(#capabilities-token). Capabilities with Tokens

"Ably Tokens":#tokens are issued from an existing "API key":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key, and their capabilities can, at most, match the capabilities of the issuing API key. "Ably JWTs":#ably-jwt have a similar restriction on capabilities, correlating to the API key they've been signed with. If an API key must be shared with a third party, then it is recommended that "the principle of least privilege":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege is considered, assigning only the capabilities needed by that third party. Thus, any Ably requests authenticated using that API key or Ably-compatible tokens associated with that API key, will be restricted to the capabilities assigned to the API key.

h4. Capability determination for Ably Tokens

* If no capability is specified in the Ably "@TokenRequest@":/realtime/types#token-request, then the "Ably Token":#ably-tokens will be given the full set of capabilities assigned to the issuing key; "see example":#capabilities-explained-all.
* If a set of capabilities are requested, then the "Ably Token":#ably-tokens will be assigned the intersection of the requested capability and the capability of the issuing key, "see example":#capabilities-explained-intersection.
* If a set of capabilities are requested, and the intersection between those and the API key's capabilities is empty (ie they are entirely incompatible), then the "Ably Token":#ably-tokens request will result in an error, "see example":#capabilities-explained-error.

h4. Capability determination for Ably JWTs

* The capabilities granted to an "Ably JWT":#ably-jwt will be the intersection of the capabilities within the "Ably JWT":#ably-jwt with the capabilities of the associated API key;
* If the set of capabilities within the "Ably JWT":#ably-jwt have no intersection with the capabilities of the API key, then an error will instead be returned, "see example":#capabilities-explained-error.

See "capability operations":#capability-operations below for the complete set of supported operations on a channel.

h3(#wildcards). Resource names and wildcards

Capabilities are a map from resources to a list of "operations":#capability-operations. Each resource can match a single channel e.g. @channel@, or multiple channels using wildcards (@*@). Wildcards can only replace whole segments (segments are delimited by @:@) of the resource name. A wildcard at the end of the name can replace arbitrarily many segments. For example:

* A resource of @*@ will match any normal channel (so not queues or metachannels, for which see below)
* A resource of @namespace:*@ will match any channel in the @namespace@ namespace, including @namespace:channel@, and @namespace:channel:other@
* A resource of @foo:*:baz@ will match @foo:bar:baz@, but not @foo:bar:bam:baz@
* A resource of @foo:*@ will match @foo:bar@, @foo:bar:bam@, @foo:bar:bam:baz@ etc., as the wildcard as at the end
* A resource of @foo*@ (without a colon!) will only match the single channel literally called @foo*@, which probably isn't what you want

A resource can also be a queue, in which case it will start with @[queue]@, e.g. @[queue]appid-queuename@. (This is unambiguous as channel names may not begin with a @[@). Similar wildcard rules apply, e.g. @[queue]*@ will match all queues.

A resource can also be a metachannel, in which case it will start with @[meta]@, e.g. @[meta]metaname@. (This is unambiguous as channel names may not begin with a @[@).  @[meta]*@ will match all metachannels. Just @*@ on its own will not: it will match all possible normal channels, but no metachannels.

You can also have a resource name of @[*]*@, which will match all queues, all metachannels, and all channels.

Wildcards are also supported for "operations":#capability-operations, by requesting an operations list of @['*']@.

h3(#capabilities-example-key). Capabilities example for API key

In order to define which capabilities an API key will have, simply select the appropriate capability boxes when "setting up your API key":https://faqs.ably.com/setting-up-and-managing-api-keys. The structure to define channels and namespaces is structurally the same as defined in the above "wildcards":#wildcards section.

h3(#capabilities-example). Capabilities example in code for tokens

If you want to see some live code examples of how capabilities work, take a look at our "capabilities example":<%= JsBins.url_for('authentication/capabilities') %>.

h4(#capabilities-explained-all). Ably Token request without capabilities example

Given an API key exists with the following capabilities:

```[json]
{
  "chat": ["publish", "subscribe", "presence"],
  "status": ["subscribe"]
}
```

If an "Ably Token":#ably-tokens is requested without requiring any capabilities:

```[javascript]
auth.requestToken(tokenCallback)
```

Then the request for an "Ably Token":#ably-tokens is treated as requesting all capabilities, i.e. @{"[*]*":["*"]}@), and all capabilities of the API key are assigned to the "Ably Token":#ably-tokens. The capabilities for the issued "Ably Token":#ably-tokens would be as follows:

```[json]
{
  "chat": ["publish", "subscribe", "presence"],
  "status": ["subscribe"]
}
```

h4(#capabilities-explained-intersection). Ably Token is requested with intersection of capabilities example

Given an API key exists with the following capabilities:

```[json]
{
  "chat:*": ["publish", "subscribe", "presence"],
  "status": ["subscribe", "history"],
  "alerts": ["subscribe"]
}
```

And an "Ably Token":#ably-tokens is requested with the following explicit capabilities:

```[javascript]
auth.requestToken({ capability: {
  "chat:bob": ["subscribe"], // only "subscribe" intersects
  "status": ["*"], // "*"" intersects with "subscribe"
  "secret": ["publish", "subscribe"] // key does not have access to "secret" channel
}}, tokenCallback)
```

Then Ably will intersect the API key's capabilities and the requested capabilities ie Ably will satisfy the requested "Ably Token's":#ably-tokens capabilities as far as possible based on the capability of the issuing API key. The capabilities for the issued "Ably Token":#ably-tokens would be as follows:

```[json]
{
  "chat:bob": ["subscribe"],
  "status": ["subscribe", "history"]
}
```

h4(#capabilities-explained-error). Ably Token is requested with incompatible capabilities

Given an API key exists with the following capabilities:

```[json]
{
  "chat": ["*"]
}
```

And an "Ably Token":#ably-tokens is requested with the following explicit capabilities:

```[javascript]
auth.requestToken({ capability: {
  "status": ["*"]
}}, tokenCallback)
```

Then Ably will be unable to issue an "Ably Token":#ably-tokens because the intersection of the requested capabilities and the API key's capabilities is empty – they are entirely incompatible. In the example above, @requestToken@ will call the callback with an error.

See a working "capabilities example":<%= JsBins.url_for('authentication/capabilities') %>.

h3(#capability-operations). Capability operations

<%= partial partial_version('core-features/_authentication_capabilities') %>

h3(#identified-clients). Understanding Identified clients

When a client is authenticated and connected to Ably, they are considered to be an *authenticated client*. However, whilst an *authenticated client* has a verifiable means to authenticate with Ably, they do not necessarily have an identity. When a client is assigned a trusted identity (ie a @client ID@), then they are considered to be an *identified client* and for all operations they perform with the Ably service, their @client ID@ field will be automatically populated and can be trusted by other clients.

For example, assuming you were building a chat application and wanted to allow clients to publish messages and be present on a channel. If each client is assigned a trusted identity by your server, such as a unique email address or UUID, then all other subscribed clients can trust any messages or presence events they receive in the channel as being from that client. No other clients are permitted to assume a @client ID@ that they are not assigned in their Ably-compatible token, that is they are unable to masquerade as another @client ID@.

In Ably a client can be identified with a @client ID@ in two ways:

* if the client is authenticated with an Ably-compatible token that is issued for that @client ID@;
* if the client claims that @client ID@ (as part of "@ClientOptions@":/realtime/usage#client-options in the "constructor":/realtime/usage) and is authenticated with an Ably-compatible token that is issued for a "wildcard @client ID@":https://faqs.ably.com/can-a-client-emulate-any-client-id-i.e.-authenticate-using-a-wildcard-client-id (a special token privilege that allows any client identity to be assumed)

We encourage customers to always issue Ably-compatible tokens to clients so that they authenticate using the short-lived token and do not have access to a customer's private API keys. Since the customer can then control the @client ID@ that may be used by any of its clients, all other clients can rely on the validity of the @client ID@ in published messages and of members present in presence channels.

The following JavaScript example demonstrates how to issue an "Ably Token":#ably-tokens  with an explicit @client ID@ that, when used by a client, will then be considered an *identified client*.

```[javascript](code-editor:realtime/auth-client-id)
  var realtime = new Ably.Rest({ key: '{{API_KEY}}' });
  realtime.auth.createTokenRequest({ clientId: 'Bob' }, function(err, tokenRequest) {
    /* ... issue the TokenRequest to a client ... */
  })
```

h2(#token-revocation). Token revocation

Token revocation is a mechanism that enables an app to invalidate authentication tokens. This invalidation can be used to force specified clients to re-obtain a token, and subsequently enables the app to modify the rights granted to clients, or to decline to re-issue a token.

The main use case of token revocation is as a method to combat malicious clients. In cases where the client behaves safely, you don't need token revocation - your code can instruct the connection to Ably to close (or detach from a channel it shouldn't have access to). But if you want to prevent any chance of a user obtaining the token before it is disconnected, and using it in their own custom client to gain access to Ably, then token revocation can be used.

Without token revocation, in order to restrict potential rogue access, you would make tokens with a short TTL (say 10 minutes) and then simply not issue a new token to a suspect client. Unfortunately, reducing the TTL would increase load on your authentication server, so token revocation can provide a more scalable solution to the issue of rogue clients.

Token revocation has to be enabled for you by Ably. There is a performance cost to enabling this feature. "Contact Ably":https://ably.com/contact if you'd like to enable this feature for a specific application.

h3(#development-status). Development status

The token revocation feature is currently in Beta.

h3. Revocable tokens

Tokens are revocable if they are created from an API key that has token revocation enabled. This sets the @revocableTokens@ attribute to @true@ for the API key.

To enable token revocation for an API key:

1. Sign into your "Ably dashboard":https://ably.com/accounts/any.
2. Open an app that has token revocation enabled.
3. Select the **API Keys** tab.
4. Open the **Settings** for an existing API key or **Create a new API key**.
5. Check the **Revocable tokens** field:

<a href="/images/screenshots/token-revocation.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/token-revocation.png" style="width: 40%" alt="Token revocation settings">
</a>

**Note:** Token revocation can only revoke tokens that were issued by an API key that had revocable tokens enabled before the token was issued.

Tokens created from an API key with revocable tokens enabled are restricted to a maximum TTL of 1 hour; an attempt to create, or present, a token that is revocable, but has a TTL of longer than 1 hr, is rejected with an error.

Initial connections to Ably and REST requests can incur a small latency cost when using revocable tokens.

h4. Revocation keys

Designating a revocation key for a token, or a group of tokens, enables the revocation process to be used at any level of granularity, depending on the needs of the application.

To designate a revocation key, include the following additional claim:

- x-ably-revocation-key := a string used to identify which token(s) to revoke in the revocation request.

h3. Token revocation API

Ably provides a token revocation API.

h4(#target-specifiers). Target specifiers

A revocation request must include one or more target specifiers which define the token(s) that are affected by the request. Where multiple target specifiers are included, this is equivalent to making multiple independent revocation requests, each for a single target. The tokens affected by a request are those that match at least one of the target specifiers included in the request.

By default, supported target specifiers are:

- clientId:<clientId> := For a string @clientId@, matches tokens that have a non-empty @clientId@ equal to that given.
- revocationKey:<revocationKey> := Matches tokens that have a @revocationKey@ claim that matches the given @revocationKey@.

The following target specifier can also be enabled for you by Ably, should your use case require it:

- channel:<resourceName> := For a @resourceName@ that exactly matches one of the "resource names":/core-features/authentication#wildcards present in the token capabilities. Note that this is not the same thing as revoking all tokens that have access to the channel. For example, a token with a capability of @{"foo:*": ["*"]}@ will be revoked by a target of @channel:foo:*@, but a revocation to @channel:*:*@ will have no effect (even though that is a superset of the capabilities of @foo:*@), and nor will @channel:foo:bar@ (even for connections using the token to attach to that particular channel). It must be the exact string used in the token capabilities (which may be inherited from key capabilities).  

h4. API endpoint

The Ably REST API contains the following endpoint for token revocation:

```
POST /keys/<keyName>/revokeTokens
```

Where the @keyName@ is @appId.keyId@.

In that request, the request body has the following form:

```[json]
{
    targets: [ "clientId:client1@example.com", "clientId:client2@example.com" ],
    issuedBefore: 1636556083000,
    allowReauthMargin: true
}
```

The request body has the following properties:

- targets := An array of "target specifier":#target-specifiers strings.
- issuedBefore := Optional number. A Unix timestamp in milliseconds where tokens issued before this time are invalidated. If @issuedBefore@ is not specified, it is set to the current time. A request with an @issuedBefore@ in the future or more than an hour in the past will be rejected.
- allowReauthMargin := Optional boolean. The @allowReauthMargin@ boolean permits a token renewal cycle to take place without needing established connections to be dropped, by postponing enforcement to 30 seconds in the future, and sending any existing connections a hint to obtain (and upgrade the connection to use) a new token. It defaults to @false@, meaning that the effect is near-immediate.

When invoking the revocation API, a client must prove possession of the key used to issue the tokens to be revoked. You can't use a key to revoke a token issued from a different key. This can be done by using basic authentication, using the API key itself.

There can be a maximum of 100 target specifiers in a single request.

The token revocation API is rate-limited, so there is a maximum global aggregate rate of revocation requests per app. The rate is configurable by Ably at the application level. As part of the process of enabling revocation on an app Ably will ask you what the maximum rate of token revocations on that app needs to be, and then provision that capacity. The decision is not permanent, it can be changed by Ably on request at any time.

Note that revocation does not permanently forbid a client, connection, @clientId@ or channel. It invalidates token credentials issued before a certain point in time. Ultimately, the app that issues tokens is responsible for whether or not a client is able to continue to interact with the Ably service.

```

h3. Revocation errors

System error responses arising from the use of an invalidated token will include an Ably @ErrorInfo@ with a @code@ of 40141 and an informative error message. This includes REST API error responses, and Ably connection @disconnected@ state changes. Such a token error is non-fatal, which means that client libraries can react to that error by triggering a token renewal where the given library options allow (that is, if an @authCallback@ or @authURL@ is specified).

h2(#tokens). Token Types

In the documentation, references to Ably-compatible tokens typically refer either to an Ably Token, or an "Ably JWT":#ably-jwt. For Ably Tokens, this can either be referring to the @TokenDetails@ object that contain the @token@ string or the token string itself. @TokenDetails@ objects are obtained when "requesting an Ably Token":/realtime/authentication#request-token from the Ably service and contain not only the @token@ string in the @token@ attribute, but also contain attributes describing the properties of the Ably Token. For "Ably JWT":#ably-jwt, this will be simply referring to a JWT which has been signed by an Ably private API key.

h3(#ably-jwt). Ably JWT

An Ably JWT is not strictly an Ably construct, rather it is a "JWT":https://jwt.io/ which has been constructed to be compatible with Ably. The JWT must adhere to the following to ensure compatibility:

* *The JOSE header must include:*
** @kid@ - Key name, such that an API key of @{{API_KEY}}@ will have key name @{{API_KEY_NAME}}@
* *The JWT claim set must include:*
** @iat@ - time of issue in seconds
** @exp@ - expiry time in seconds
* *The JWT claim set may include:*
** @x-ably-capability@ - JSON text encoding of the "capability":https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#tokens
** @x-ably-clientId@ - client ID

Arbitrary additional claims and headers are supported (apart from those prefixed with @x-ably-@ which are reserved for future use).

The Ably JWT must be signed with the secret part of your "Ably API key":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key using the signature algorithm HS256 (HMAC using the SHA-256 hash algorithm). View the "JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification":https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518 for further information.

We recommend you use one of the many "JWT libraries available for simplicity":https://jwt.io/ when creating your JWTs.

The following is an example of creating an Ably JWT:

```[javascript](code-editor:authentication/jwt-token)
  var header = {
    "typ":"JWT",
    "alg":"HS256",
    "kid": "{{API_KEY_NAME}}"
  };
  var currentTime = Math.round(Date.now()/1000);
  var claims = {
    "iat": currentTime, /* current time in seconds */
    "exp": currentTime + 3600, /* time of expiration in seconds */
    "x-ably-capability": "{\"*\":[\"*\"]}"
  };
  var base64Header = btoa(header);
  var base64Claims = btoa(claims);
  /* Apply the hash specified in the header */
  var signature = hash((base64Header + "." + base64Claims), "{{API_KEY_SECRET}}");
  var ablyJwt = base64Header + "." + base64Claims + "." + signature;
```

*Note:* At present Ably does not support asymmetric signatures based on a keypair belonging to a third party. If this is something you'd be interested in, please "get in touch":https://ably.com/contact.

h2(#auth-object). Auth object

The principal use-case for the @Auth@ object is to create Ably "@TokenRequest@":/realtime/authentication#token-request objects with "createTokenRequest":/realtime/authentication#create-token-request or obtain "Ably Tokens":#ably-tokens from Ably with "requestToken":#request-token, and then issue them to other "less trusted" clients. Typically, your servers should be the only devices to have a "private API key":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key, and this private API key is used to securely sign Ably "@TokenRequest@":/realtime/authentication#token-request objects or request "Ably Tokens":#ably-tokens from Ably. Clients are then issued with these short-lived "Ably Tokens":#ably-tokens or Ably "@TokenRequest@":/realtime/authentication#token-request objects, and the libraries can then use these to authenticate with Ably. If you adopt this model, your private API key is never shared with clients directly.

A subsidiary use-case for the @Auth@ object is to preemptively trigger renewal of a token or to acquire a new token with a revised set of capabilities by explicitly calling "<span lang="default">@authorize@</span><span lang="csharp">@Authorize@</span>":/realtime/authentication#authorize.

Descriptions of this object exist in both the "Realtime":/realtime/authentication#auth-options and "REST":/rest/authentication#auth-options libraries.
