The Standard package is for when you're ready to start rolling out your application into production.

## Features <a id="features"/>

The Standard package includes the following limits on the key units of consumption:

| Limit | Standard |
| ----- | -------- |
| Message rate (per second) | 2,500 |
| Messages (per month) | Unlimited |
| Concurrent channels | 10,000 |
| Concurrent connections | 10,000 |

Standard package users also have access to the following features:

* Google and GitHub SSO
* [DataDog Lite](/docs/platform/integrations/streaming/datadog#lite) (30 day trial)

## Pricing and billing <a id="pricing"/>

The Standard package has a monthly fee of $29, plus your usage. You will be billed for the previous month's usage.

## Limits <a id="limits"/>

[Compare the limits](/docs/platform/pricing/limits) associated with each package to see those available on the Standard package.

## Support <a id="support"/>

Standard package support includes access to Ably support via email with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of less than 1 business day for general guidance and for system impediments or system down.

## Upgrade from Free to Standard <a id="free-standard"/>

To upgrade your account from a Free package to a Standard package:

1. Ensure you are the [account owner](/docs/platform/account/users).
2. Log in to your [account](https://ably.com/login) and select **Billing** from the **Account** menu.
3. Choose the plan you wish to upgrade to and follow the instructions. Upgrades take effect immediately.

Note that your first invoice will be issued at the start of the following calendar month. It covers usage from the point of upgrade up until the end of that month. All subsequent invoices will follow the same pattern of billing for the previous month's usage. The base package price will be charged pro-rata from the point in the month that you upgraded.

Once you upgrade to a Standard, your usage is counted from that point onwards. For example, if you upgrade in the middle of the month on a per per minute model, you are charged for the first message you send after upgrading, not after the 6,000,000 messages allowed on the Free package.

## Upgrade from Standard to Pro <a id="standard-pro"/>

To upgrade your account from a Standard package to a Pro package:

1. Ensure you are the [account owner](/docs/platform/account/users).
2. Log in to your [account](https://ably.com/login) and select **Billing** from the **Account** menu.
3. Choose the plan you wish to upgrade to and follow the instructions. Upgrades take effect immediately.

The base package price will be charged pro-rata from the point in the month that you upgraded. This is true for the current Standard package base price, as well as the upgraded [Pro package](/docs/platform/pricing/pro) base price.

## Upgrade from Standard to Enterprise <a id="standard-enterprise"/>

To upgrade your account from a Standard package to an [Enterprise package](/docs/platform/pricing/enterprise), [contact us](https://ably.com/contact?cta=enterprise_package) to discuss your options.

## Downgrade <a id="downgrade"/>

To downgrade your account from a Standard package to Free:

1. Ensure you are the [account owner](/docs/platform/account/users).
2. Log in to your [account](https://ably.com/login) and select **Billing** from the **Account** menu.
3. Click the **Downgrade** button.

If you downgrade to the [Free package](/docs/platform/pricing/free), you will remain on the Standard package with its limits and benefits until the end of your billing cycle (on the 1st of the month). At the start of the following month, you will receive a final invoice that includes the full Standard package fee and any usage for the previous month.

## Close your account <a id="close"/>

You can [close your account](/docs/platform/account/users#close) at any time by first downgrading to the Free package.
