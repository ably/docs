# Error 50210: Bad Gateway

## What Happened

Ably's edge proxy service received an invalid response from the upstream Ably platform servers when attempting to process your request.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 50210 | 502 | Server Error (Edge Proxy) | Yes - temporary infrastructure issue |

## Quick Fix

- No immediate action required - Ably SDKs handle retry automatically
- Check [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) if persistent
- Implement exponential backoff if using REST API directly

## Error Messages

You may see this message:
- "Ably's edge proxy service received an invalid (bad gateway) response from the Ably platform"

## Common Causes

<!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50210-knowledge.md lines 23-27 -->
1. **Upstream platform issues** (Most common)
   - Ably platform servers returning invalid responses during incidents
   - Service degradation during high load periods

2. **Transient network issues**
   - Temporary connectivity problems between CloudFront and Ably platform
   - Network routing issues between edge locations and core infrastructure

3. **Regional outages**
   - Affecting specific CloudFront edge locations
   - Localized infrastructure problems

## Resolution Steps

1. **For transient errors (most cases)**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50210-knowledge.md lines 73-77 -->
   - Ably SDKs automatically retry with appropriate backoff
   - No action required unless error persists for more than 2 minutes

2. **For persistent errors (>2 minutes)**
   - Check https://status.ably.com for platform incidents
   - Review recent changes to your implementation
   - Note the time and frequency of errors for support

3. **If using REST API directly**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50210-knowledge.md lines 79-87 -->
   - Implement exponential backoff retry logic
   - Start with 1 second delay, doubling up to 32 seconds
   - Include jitter to avoid thundering herd effect

4. **For batch operations**
   <!-- Source: Support history from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50210-knowledge.md lines 31-42 -->
   - Keep track of failed batches for manual replay if needed
   - Consider implementing circuit breaker patterns for repeated failures
   - Monitor for patterns (time of day, specific operations)

## Automatic Handling

<!-- Source: Engineering discussion from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50210-knowledge.md lines 56-60 -->
Ably SDKs automatically retry server errors with exponential backoff. However, some older SDK versions may incorrectly wrap this in a 400 error, preventing automatic retry. Ensure you're using a current SDK version for proper error handling.

## Prevention

- Use current SDK versions for proper error handling
- Implement monitoring for 50210 errors to detect patterns
- Consider geographic distribution of requests to avoid single edge location issues
- Keep batch sizes reasonable to minimize impact of failures

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Detailed CloudFront edge proxy architecture documentation
- Impact: Users don't understand the infrastructure layers involved
- Recommendation: Add edge proxy section to infrastructure documentation
- Severity: Medium - affects understanding but not resolution
-->
