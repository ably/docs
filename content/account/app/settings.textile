Manage your Ably application settings including security, billing, authentication, and protocol support to optimize performance and enhance security.

h3. Application settings overview

The following provides an overview of your application settings.

|_. Section |_. Description |
| *App ID* | This ID is automatically generated by Ably when you create an application. It is a critical part of your application's identity and is included in every API key and token issued for your application. |
| *Name* | This is the user-defined name that you assigned when creating your application. It is helpful for quickly identifying the application among others in your dashboard, especially if you manage multiple applications. |
| *Security* | Enabled by default, this option enforces Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all connections to your application. TLS protocol ensures data encryption and secure communication between clients and servers. |
| *Enabled* | When an application is *disabled*, it no longer accepts new connections and deactivates all associated services. Clients cannot connect, send or receive messages, or use other Ably services. When *enabled*, the application allows new connections and activates all related services. |

h3. Channel rule configuration

The following explains the configuration rules for specific "namespaces":/channels#namespaces or "channels:":/channels

|_. Section |_. Description |
| *Namespace or channel ID* | Identify the specific namespace or channel to which this rule will apply. |
| *Persist last message* | Stores the last message published on a channel for 365 days, accessible via the rewind mechanism. |
| *Persist all messages* | Ably stores all messages for two minutes by default. Depending on your account package, this can be increased to 24 or 72 hours. It is also possible to persist the last message sent to a channel for a year. |
| *Identified* | Requires clients to authenticate with a client ID to interact with channels in this namespace. |
| *TLS only* | Restricts access to channels within this namespace to clients connected using TLS. |
| *Push notifications enabled* | Enables publishing messages with a push payload, triggering native push notifications to registered devices. |
| *Message interactions enabled* | Enables unique time serial fields in messages, enabling typed references between messages (e.g., implementing 'Likes' in a chat). |
| *Server-side batching enabled* | Batches inbound messages on the server side before sending them to subscribers based on the configured policy. |
| *Cancel* | Discards changes and closes the dialog without saving the new rule.|

h3. Protocol adapter settings

The following explains the configuration support for various communication protocols ("Pusher":/protocols/pusher, "PubNub":/protocols/pubnub, "MQTT":/protocols/mqtt), enabling different client libraries to interact with Ably.

|_. Settings  |_. Description |
| *Pusher protocol support* | Provides compatibility with the Pusher protocol. |
| *PubNub protocol support* | Provides compatibility with the PubNub protocol. |
| *MQTT protocol support* | Provides compatibility with the MQTT protocol. |

h3. Actions

*Delete this app now* to permanently delete your app including your message history, statistics and prevent access to Ably with any of the API keys assigned to this app.
