## Methods <a id="#methods" />

### stats <a id="stats" />

<If lang="javascript,nodejs">

`stats(Object params?): Promise<PaginatedResult<Stats>>`

</If>

<If lang="ruby">

`Deferrable stats(Hash options) â†’ yields PaginatedResult<Stats>`

</If>

<If lang="java">

<If lang="csharp">

`Task<PaginatedResult<Stats>> StatsAsync(StatsRequestParams query)`

</If>

This call queries the [REST `/stats` API](/docs/api/rest-api#stats) and retrieves your application's usage statistics. A [PaginatedResult](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#paginated-result) is returned, containing an array of [Stats](#stats-type) for the first page of results. [PaginatedResult](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#paginated-result) objects are iterable providing a means to page through historical statistics. [See an example set of raw stats returned via the REST API](/docs/metadata-stats/stats#metrics).

#### Returns

Returns a promise. On success, the promise is fulfilled with a [PaginatedResult](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#paginated-result) object containing an array of [Stats](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#stats) objects. On failure, the promise is rejected with an [ErrorInfo](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#error-info) object.

</If>

<If lang="objc,swift">

#### Callback result

On success, `result` contains a [PaginatedResult](#paginated-result) encapsulating an array of [Stats](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#stats) objects corresponding to the current page of results. [PaginatedResult](#paginated-result) supports pagination using [next](#paginated-result) and [first](#paginated-result) methods.

On failure to retrieve stats, `err` contains an [ErrorInfo](#error-info) object with an error response as defined in the [Ably REST API](/docs/api/rest-api#common) documentation.

</If>

<If lang="java">

#### Returns

On success, the returned [PaginatedResult](#paginated-result) encapsulates an array of [Stats](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#stats) objects corresponding to the current page of results. [PaginatedResult](#paginated-result) supports pagination using [next](#paginated-result) and [first](#paginated-result) methods.

Failure to retrieve the stats will raise an [AblyException](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#ably-exception)

</If>

<If lang="csharp">

#### Returns

Returns a `Task<PaginatedResult>` which needs to be awaited.

On success, the returned [PaginatedResult](#paginated-result) encapsulates an array of [Stats](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#stats) objects corresponding to the current page of results. [PaginatedResult](#paginated-result) supports pagination using [NextAsync](#paginated-result) and [FirstAsync](#paginated-result) methods.

Failure to retrieve the stats will raise an [AblyException](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#ably-exception)

</If>

<If lang="ruby">

#### Returns

A [Deferrable](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable) object is returned from the stats method.

On success, the registered success callbacks for the [Deferrable](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable) and any block provided to the method yields a [PaginatedResult](#paginated-result) that encapsulates an array of [Stats](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#stats) objects corresponding to the current page of results. [PaginatedResult](#paginated-result) supports pagination using [next](#paginated-result) and [first](#paginated-result) methods.

Failure to retrieve the stats will trigger the errback callbacks of the [Deferrable](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable) with an [ErrorInfo](#error-info) object containing an error response as defined in the [Ably REST API](/docs/api/rest-api#common) documentation.

A `Stats` object represents an application's statistics for the specified interval and time period. Ably aggregates statistics globally for all accounts and applications, and makes these available both through our [statistics API](/docs/metadata-stats/stats) as well as your [application dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard).

<If lang="ruby,java,objc,swift,csharp">

Please note that most attributes of the `Stats` type below contain references to further stats types. This documentation is not exhaustive for all stats types, and as such, links to the stats types below will take you to the [Ruby library stats documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ably/Ably/Models/Stats) which contains exhaustive stats documentation. Ruby and Python however uses `under_score` case instead of the default `camelCase` in most languages, so please bear that in mind.
