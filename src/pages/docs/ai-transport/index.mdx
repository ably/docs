Ably AI Transport is a solution for building stateful, steerable, multi-device AI experiences into new or existing applications. You can use AI Transport as the transport layer with any LLM or agent framework, without rebuilding your existing stack or being locked to a particular vendor.

## Key features

AI Transport builds on [Ably Pub/Sub](/docs/basics) to enable reliable interactive AI experiences at scale and provides the following key features:

// TODO: Check this lines up with planned doc sections
* [Reliable, resumable token streams](#reliable-tokens)
* [Session management](#session)
* [Complex message patterns](#message)
* [Enterprise controls](#enterprise)

### Reliable, resumable token streams <a id="reliable-tokens"/>

Ably AI Transport enables you to [stream tokens](/docs/ai-transport/features/token-streaming) reliably from your AI agent to your client devices using a channel. The token stream survives reconnections and token history is available for any new clients that connect.

### Session management <a id="session"/>

With AI Transport, communication between the client and agent is not tied to the connection state of either party. This gives you much more control over how to manage session lifetime and opens up opportunities for improved user experience, for example push notifications to offline users when a long-running task completes.

### Complex message patterns <a id="message"/>

Truly interactive AI experiences require more than a simple HTTP request-response exchange between a single client and agent. AI transport allows the use of [complex messaging patterns](//TODO: Link here), for example:
* A user can communicate with multiple agents in a single channel and receive their responses simultaneously, along with any references or citations the model may supply.
* A user can send additional requests or redirections while a response is in progress, instead of waiting until the response is complete.

### Enterprise controls <a id="enterprise"/>

Ably's platform provides [integrations](/docs/platform/integrations) and capabilities to ensure that your application will meet the requirements of enterprise environments, for example [message auditing](/docs/platform/integrations/streaming), [client identification](/docs/auth/identified-clients) and [RBAC](/docs/auth/capabilities).

## Model SDKs and frameworks <a id="sdks-frameworks"/>

Ably AI Transport can be used as the transport layer for any model or agent framework you choose to use in your stack, giving you full control of your technology decisions. Ably's how-to guides show example integrations with a selection of common SDKs and frameworks.

// TODO: link these to our guides, or to their own docs? Also check that this list is accurate at the point we release
* OpenAI Responses API
* OpenAI Agents SDK
* Claude Client SDK
* Claude Agents SDK
* LangChain
* LangGraph
* Vercel AI SDK Core

If your chosen model or framework is not listed and you need additional help to design the integration with Ably then please contact [Support](/support).
