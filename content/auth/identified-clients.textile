title: Identified clients
meta_description: "Clients can be allocated a client ID to help control their operations and interactions with Ably channels."
---

When a client is authenticated and connected to Ably, it is considered to be an *authenticated client*. 

However, while an *authenticated client* has a means to authenticate with Ably, they do not necessarily have an identity. 

When a client is assigned a trusted identity, that is, a @clientId@, then they are considered to be an *identified client*, and for all operations they perform with the Ably service, their @ClientId@ field will be automatically populated and can be trusted by other clients.

For example, assume you were building a chat application and wanted to allow clients to publish messages and be present on a channel. If each client is assigned a trusted identity by your server, such as a unique email address or UUID, then all other subscribed clients can trust any messages or presence events they receive in the channel as being from that client. No other clients are permitted to assume a @clientId@ that they are not assigned in their Ably-compatible token, that is, they are unable to masquerade as another @clientId@.

h2. Assigning a clientId

Typically, when using the token authentication scheme for clients, a client ID is assigned in one of the following ways:

* An explicit @clientId@ string is provided when creating the token. Clients using that token are restricted to operations for only that @clientId@, and all operations will implicitly contain that @clientId@. For example, when publishing a message, the @clientId@ attribute of the message will be prepopulated with that @clientId@. Entering presence will also implicitly use that @clientId@.
* No @clientId@ is provided when creating the token. Clients using that token will not be permitted to assume an identity and all operations will be assumed to come from an unidentified client, that is, the @clientId@ attribute will be omitted from any messages published. Unidentified clients are not permitted to participate in presence.
* The wildcard @clientId@ string "*" is provided when creating the token. Client using that token are able to assume any identity in all operations including publish messages and entering presence.

Ably encourages customers to always issue Ably-compatible tokens to clients so that they authenticate using the short-lived token and do not have access to a customer's private API keys. Since the customer can then control the @clientId@ that may be used by any of its clients, all other clients can rely on the validity of the @clientId@ in published messages and of members present in presence channels.

h2. Code example - creating an identified client

The following JavaScript example demonstrates how to issue an "Ably TokenRequest":/api/realtime-sdk/authentication#token-details with an explicit @clientId@ that, when used by a client, will then be considered an *identified client*.

```[javascript]
  const realtime = new Ably.Rest({ key: '{{API_KEY}}' });
  realtime.auth.createTokenRequest({ clientId: 'Bob' }, (err, tokenRequest) => {
    /* ... issue the TokenRequest to a client ... */
  })
```
