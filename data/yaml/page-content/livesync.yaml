      LiveSync enables you to synchronize changes in your database to frontend clients at scale.
      LiveSync is designed to be database agnostic with support for PostgreSQL in its Alpha release version.
      It uses Ably's global message delivery network to sync app data in realtime.

      There are two flavours of LiveSync; the MongoDB connector, and the Postgres connector with the Models SDK. Both allow your to broadcast changes happening in our database and data models in realtime to subscribed clients.
