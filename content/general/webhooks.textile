Reactor WebHooks allow your server to be notified via an HTTP request following channel lifecycle events (such as channel creation), presence events (such as members entering or leaving) or messages being published. WebHooks are offered as part of our "Ably Reactor Event service":https://www.ably.io/reactor, a service available to all customers of the Ably platform.

p(tip). WebHooks are "rate limited":#transport and are suitable for low to medium volumes of updates. If you expect a high volume of events and messages (upwards of 20 per second), then you should consider using our "message queues":/general/queues or "firehose":/general/firehose as they are more suitable for higher volumes.

Generally, customers who want to receive events as they happen, use our "message queues":/general/queues or "firehose":/general/firehose, or alternatively our "realtime client libraries":/realtime and subscribe to events and messages published. However, some customers prefer to be notified over HTTP when events occur such as a user publishing a message, attaching to a channel, or members entering the presence set on a channel. For example, a customer may want to start pushing content to a channel only when the channel becomes active and there is someone there to receive the data, or they may want to send a welcome message to someone when they first enter a chat channel. A WebHook is useful feature to achieve this in both these scenarios.

WebHooks can be used to trigger execution of code on your servers over HTTP when a message is published or event occurs. If you would prefer to trigger server-less functions such as Amazon Lambda, see our "Reactor Functions":/general/functions.

Ably currently supports three types of WebHooks:

* "Channel lifecycle events":#channel-lifecycle - get notified when a channel is created (following the first client attaching to this channel) or discarded (when there are no more clients attached to the channel)
* "Presence events":#presence - get notified when clients enter, update their data, or leave channels
* "Messages":#messages - get notified when messages are published on a channel

In order to prevent overloading your servers with requests, Ably batches WebHook data and issues a @POST@ request with @JSON@ (by default) data in the body of the request to your servers. See "binary support":#binary below for details on how to use @MsgPack@ for greater efficiency with a binary encoding. WebHook requests are typically published at most once per second per configured WebHook. See "WebHook transport details":#transport below for the specifics on throughput, restrictions and expected behavior of WebHooks.

You can "configure WebHooks":#configure in your "account dashboard":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000048664-how-do-i-access-my-account-dashboard on a per app basis which can apply to one or more channels in that app. WebHooks can be filtered by channel naming using a regular expression.

You can also optionally "configure your WebHook to sign the requests":#security allowing you to verify the authenticity of each request.

h2(#channel-lifecycle). Channel lifecycle events

If you are unfamiliar with how channels work in Ably, we recommend you first review the "realtime channel lifecycle documentation":/realtime/channels-messages#channels.

When a client attaches to a channel, a channel is implicitly created within the global Ably service triggering a @channel.opened@ WebHook event. The channel will remain open for as long as there are any subscribers attached to the channel.  Once all subscribers have left the channel, as part of our garbage collection process, the channel will typically be closed within 15 seconds triggering a @channel.closed@ event.

Every WebHook request will contain one or more lifecycle events in the root level attribute @items@ which contains an array of events. See "WebHook transport details":#webhook-transport below to find out more about batching and expected throughput.

Each channel lifecycle event in the @items@ array consists of an object with the following attributes:

- name := the event type "@channel.opened@" or "@channel.closed@"
- data := an object containing a single attribute @name@ which is the name of the channel that the lifecycle event applies to
- webhookId := an internal unique ID for the configured WebHook
- source := the source for the WebHook, namely "@channel.lifecycle@"
- timestamp := a timestamp represented as milliseconds since epoch for the channel event

h4. Example @channel.opened@ JSON payload

```[json]
{
   "items":[
      {
         "webhookId":"M8T4-Q",
         "source":"channel.lifecycle",
         "serial":"4ab22b4793288073:1",
         "timestamp":1467280480250,
         "name":"channel.opened",
         "data":{
            "name":"livechat"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

h4. Example @channel.closed@ JSON payload

```[json]
{
   "items":[
      {
         "webhookId":"M8T4-Q",
         "source":"channel.lifecycle",
         "serial":"4ab22b4793288073:5",
         "timestamp":1467280554968,
         "name":"channel.closed",
         "data":{
            "name":"livechat"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

h2(#presence). Presence events

If you are unfamiliar with how presence works in Ably and what events are supported, we recommend you first review the "realtime presence documentation":/realtime/presence.

When a member enters, updates, or leaves a channel, a presence WebHook event is triggered.

Every WebHook request will contain one or more presence event envelopes in the root level @items@ attribute, each of which in turn contains an array of presence events. See "WebHook transport details":#webhook-transport below to find out more about batching and expected throughput.

Each presence event envelope in the @items@ array consists of an object with the following attributes:

- name := the event type "@presence.message@"
- webhookId := an internal unique ID for the configured WebHook
- source := the source for the WebHook, namely "@channel.presence@"
- timestamp := a timestamp represented as milliseconds since the epoch for the presence event
- data := an object containing the attributes defined below in "JSONPath format":http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/ @data.*@:
- data.channelId := name of the channel that the presence event belongs to
- data.site := an internal site identifier indicating which primary data center the member is present in
- data.presence := an @Array@ of presence events

Each member of @data.presence@ has the following fields:

- clientId := the client identifier for the member. Find out more about "identified clients":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000038608-authenticated-and-identified-clients
- connectionId := the public unique identifier for the connection the member is using. Find out more about "@connectionId@":/realtime/connection#id
- action := the presence action, as an integer defined by the "PresenceMessage Action enum":https://www.ably.io/documentation/realtime/types#presence-action . (Note that in old webhooks, identified by an @X-ABLY-VERSION@ header of @"0.8"@, this field was a string; in newly created webhooks it is an integer in order to be decodable by @PresenceMessage#fromEncoded@, see below)
- data := an optional payload if provided when present. Find out more about "member data":/realtime/presence/#member-data
- encoding := if the data payload is present, this encoding specifies the format of the data. If missing or empty, then the data payload is a string type. For example, if JSON data is added to a presence member's "@data@":/realtime/presence/#member-data, then the @encoding@ would be "@json/utf-8@"
- id := unique ID assigned by Ably to this presence event
- timestamp := the time in milliseconds since the epoch when this presence event was received by Ably

h4. Decoding presence events

Each member of @data.presence@ is a 'raw' presence event. Presence messages sent "over the realtime service":/realtime/channels-messages are automatically decoded into "@PresenceMessages@":/realtime/types#presence-message object by the Ably client library. With webhooks you need to to do this explicitly, using "@PresenceMessage.fromEncodedArray@":/realtime/presence#presence-from-encoded-array on the @data.presence@ array, or "@PresenceMessage.fromEncoded@":/realtime/presence#presence-from-encoded or an individual member of that array. This will transform them into an array of "@PresenceMessages@":/realtime/types#presence-message (or in the case of @fromEncoded@, an individual "@PresenceMessage@":/realtime/types#presence-message). This has several advantages, e.g.:

* It will decode the (numerical) action into a "@Presence action@":/realtime/presence#presence-action string (such as "@enter@", "@update@", or "@leave@")
* It will fully decode any @data@ (using the @encoding@) back into the same datatype that it was sent in (or an equivalent in each client library's language)
* If you are using "encryption":/realtime/encryption, you can pass your encryption key to the method and it will decrypt the @data@ for you

We recommend you do this for all presence messages you receive over webhooks. For example (using ably-js):

```[javascript]
webhookMessage.items.forEach((item) => {
  const presMsgs = Ably.Realtime.PresenceMessage.fromEncodedArray(item.data.presence);
  presMsgs.forEach((presenceMessage) => {
    console.log(presenceMessage.toString());
  })
})
```

                  "timestamp":1487253048676
               }
            ]

               }
            ]
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

h2(#messages). Messages

When a message is published on a channel, a message WebHook event is triggered.

Every WebHook request will contain one or more enveloped messages in the root level attribute @items@, each of which in turn contains one or messages. See "WebHook transport details":#webhook-transport below to find out more about batching and expected throughput.

Each message envelope in the @items@ array consists of an object with the following attributes:

- name := the event type "@channel.message@"
- webhookId := an internal unique ID for the configured WebHook
- source := the source for the WebHook, namely "@channel.message@"
- timestamp := a timestamp represented as milliseconds since epoch for the published message
- data := an object containing the attributes defined below in "JSONPath format":http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/ @data.*@:
- data.channelId := name of the channel that the presence event belongs to
- data.site := an internal site identifier indicating the data center from which the message was published
- data.messages := an @Array@ of messages with fields for each message described below

Each member of @data.messages@ has the following fields:

- clientId := optional client identifier for the publisher of the message. Find out more about "identified clients":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000038608-authenticated-and-identified-clients
- connectionId := the public unique identifier for the publisher's connection. Find out more about "@connectionId@":/realtime/connection#id
- name := a string representing the event name for the published message, see the "publish method":/rest/channels-messages#publish
- data := an optional data payload for the published message. Find out more about "message data":/rest/channels-messages#message
- encoding := if the data payload is present, this encoding specifies the format of the data. If missing or empty, then the data payload is a string type. For example, if JSON data is set for the published message's "@data@":/rest/channels-messages/#message attribute, then the @encoding@ would be "@json/utf-8@"
- id := unique ID assigned by Ably to this message
- timestamp := the time in milliseconds since the epoch when this message was received by Ably

h4. Decoding messages

Each member of @data.messages@ is a 'raw' message. Messages sent "over the realtime service":/realtime/channels-messages are automatically decoded into "@Messages@":/realtime/types#message object by the Ably client library. With webhooks you need to to do this explicitly, using "@Message.fromEncodedArray@":/realtime/channels-messages#message-from-encoded-array on the @data.messages@ array, or "@Message.fromEncoded@":/realtime/channels-messages#message-from-encoded or an individual member of that array. This will transform them into an array of "@Messages@":/realtime/types#message (or in the case of @fromEncoded@, an individual "@Message@":/realtime/types#message). This has several advantages, e.g.:

* It will fully decode any @data@ (using the @encoding@) back into the same datatype that it was sent in (or an equivalent in each client library's language)
* If you are using "encryption":/realtime/encryption, you can pass your encryption key to the method and it will decrypt the @data@ for you

We recommend you do this for all messages you receive over webhooks. For example (using ably-js):

```[javascript]
webhookMessage.items.forEach((item) => {
  const messages = Ably.Realtime.Message.fromEncodedArray(item.data.messages);
  messages.forEach((message) => {
    console.log(message.toString());
  })
})
```


h4. Example @channel.message@ JSON payload

```[json]
{
   "items":[
      {
         "webhookId":"d28HJw",
         "source":"channel.message",
         "serial":"e91URQe6QA0gwm05496618:2",
         "timestamp":1479301189860,
         "name":"channel.message",
         "data":{
            "channelId":"foob",
            "site":"eu-central-1-A",
            "messages":[
               {
                  "id":"9qaOH1C4tO:2:0",
                  "name":"foo",
                  "connectionId":"9qaOH1C4tO",
                  "timestamp":1479301189856,
                  "data":"bar"
               }
            ]
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

Please note that if you are planning to receive messages via WebHooks, it is theoretically very easy to exceed the "transport rate limits":#transport we impose on WebHooks to prevent DoS attacks against your own servers. We recommend you consider "message queues":/general/queues instead as they are far more scalable.

h2(#configure). Configuring a WebHook

WebHooks are configured in your "account dashboard":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000048664-how-do-i-access-my-account-dashboard. The following fields are available for each configured WebHook:

- events := Allows you to choose to receive either @Channel Lifecycle@, @Message@, or @Presence@ events
- url := The URL of your server where the WebHook JSON data is posted
- custom headers := Optionally allows you to provide a set of headers that will be included in all HTTP POST requests. You must use the JSON array like format @["XCustom-Header-1:value1","Custom-Header-2:value2"]@
- sign with key := Ably will optionally sign the data with the private key you choose and include an HTTP header @X-Ably-Signature@ in every HTTP post request issued to your server. See "WebHook security":#security for more details.

h2(#transport). WebHook transport details

WebHook requests are batched for efficiency and rate limited to ensure that we do not overload customer's servers with requests. Each request is sent as an HTTP POST request with a JSON content type in the body of the request.

h3. Rate limits

* For each configured WebHook, up to one request per second will be made to the configured endpoint URL
* The first event that matches a configured WebHook will trigger a WebHook request immediately. Therefore, if you have a low volume of events you are listening to, in most cases your request should arrive in under a second from the time the event was generated
* Once a WebHook request is triggered, all other events will be queued so that they can be delivered in a batch in the next request. The next WebHook request will be issued within one second with the following caveats:
** Only one HTTP request is ever in-flight at one time for each configured WebHook. If for example your server takes 6 seconds to respond to the request, then you can expect no more than 10 requests a minute to your endpoint. Therefore, if you want to be notified quickly, we recommend you accept requests quickly and defer any work to be done asynchronously
** If there are more than 1,000 events queued for the next WebHook, the oldest 1,000 events will be bundled into the next WebHook and the remaining events will be delivered in the next WebHook. Therefore, if your sustained rate of events is expected to be more than 1,000 per second or your servers are slow to respond, then it is possible a backlog will build up and you will not receive all events. "Get in touch if you need a higher sustained rate":https://www.ably.io/contact

h3. Failures and back off

* If the endpoint for any of the WebHook requests respond with an HTTP status code that does not indicate success i.e. @200 - 209@, then Ably will retry that failed request
* Every retry is performed with an incrementing back off that is calculated as @delay = delay * sqrt(2)@ where delay is initially @1@. For example, if the initial WebHook request fails, and subsequent for retries fail, the back off delays for each request would look as follows: @initial request > wait 1.4s > 1st retry > wait 2s > 2nd retry > wait 2.8s > 3rd retry > wait 4s > 4th retry > wait 5.6s > successful request@
* The back off for consecutively failing requests will increase until it reaches 60s. All subsequent retries for failed requests will then be made every 60s until a request is successful
* The queue of events is retained for 5 minutes. If an event cannot be delivered within 5 minutes, then the events are discarded to prevent the queue from growing indefinitely

h2(#binary). Binary support

By default WebHooks are delivered using the portable "JSON text encoding":http://www.json.org/. We also support "MsgPack":http://msgpack.org/, a binary encoding that generally provides faster decoding and smaller payloads.  This is configurable in your "WebHooks dashboard":#configure.

h2(#security). WebHook security

We encourage customers to use a secure HTTPS URL when configuring their WebHooks. This will ensure that requests cannot be intercepted and all communication with your servers is secured with TLS.

However, in addition, we optionally support a signature included as an HTTP header @X-Ably-Signature@. Customers who receive WebHooks can then use the chosen private API key to verify the authenticity of the WebHook data.

In order to verify the signature, you need to do the following:

* start with the webhook request body. This will be a JSON string encoded with content-encoding @utf-8@;
* identify the key based on the @keyId@ indicated in the @X-Ably-Key@ header;
* calculate the HMAC of that request body with algorithm SHA-256 and the key being the corresponding @keyValue@ (the secret part of the key after the "@:@");
* encode the resulting HMAC using RFC 3548 base 64;
* compare that result with the signature value indicated in the @X-Ably-Signature@ header

h3. WebHook HMAC SHA-256 signature verification example

If you choose to sign your WebHook requests, we recommend you try the following first:

# "Set up a free RequestBin HTTP endpoint test URL":http://requestb.in/
# "Configure a WebHook":#configure with the URL set to the RequestBin endpoint and ensure you have chosen a key to sign each WebHook request
# Trigger an event using the Dev Console in your app dashboard which will generate a WebHook. You should then confirm that the WebHook has been received in your RequestBin
# Check that the @X-Ably-Signature@ header in your WebHook request matches the HMAC SHA-256 you create using our "Javascript HMAC SHA-256 demo":<%= JsBins.url_for('reactor/webhook-hmac-sha-256') %>
