The following capability operations are available for API keys and issued tokens.

- subscribe := can subscribe to messages and presence state change messages on channels, and get the presence set of a channel
- publish := can publish messages to channels

- history := can retrieve message and presence state history on channels
- stats := can retrieve current and historical usage statistics for an app
- push-subscribe := can subscribe devices for push notifications
- push-admin := can manage device registrations and push subscriptions for all devices in an app
- channel-metadata := can get metadata for a channel, and enumerate channels

See a working "capabilities example":<%= JsBins.url_for('authentication/capabilities') %>, read "understanding capabilities and token security":/core-features/authentication#capabilities-explained above to get a more thorough overview of how capabilities can be used to secure your application along with working examples.

While most of these capabilities need to be enabled for the resource you're using them with, as described in "resource names and wildcards":/core-features/authentication#wildcards above, there are exceptions. The @stats@ permission only does anything when attached to the wildcard resource @'*'@ (or a resource that contains that as a subset, such as @'[*]*'@), since stats are app-wide. The @channel-metadata@ permission works both ways. When associated with a specific channel or set of channels it allows you to use the "Channel Status API":/rest/channel-status#channel-status to request the status of that channel. When associated with the wilcard resource @'*'@ it takes on an additional meaning: as well as allowing channel status requests for all channels, it also allows you to "enumerate all active channels":/rest/channel-status#enumeration-rest
