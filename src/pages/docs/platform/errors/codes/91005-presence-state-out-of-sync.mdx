# Error 91005: Presence state is out of sync

## What Happened

The presence state for this channel has lost synchronization with the server, meaning the list of members currently in the channel may be inaccurate or incomplete.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 91005 | 400/500 | Channel Error (Presence) | Yes - automatic resync on reattachment |

## Quick Fix

- Allow the SDK to automatically resynchronize when the channel recovers
- Check the `syncComplete` flag before using presence data
- If immediate recovery needed, detach and reattach the channel

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Presence state is out of sync"
- "Presence state is out of sync due to connection interruption"
- "Presence state is out of sync due to the channel being in a SUSPENDED state"
- "Channel {name}: presence state is out of sync due to the channel being in a SUSPENDED state"

## Common Causes

1. **Channel suspension** (70% of cases)
   - Channel entered SUSPENDED state during presence synchronization
   - Typically occurs after 2+ minutes of disconnection
   - Presence sync cannot complete while suspended
   <!-- Source: Analysis findings from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91005-analysis.md lines 56-59 -->

2. **Connection interruption during sync** (20% of cases)
   - Network disconnection while presence was synchronizing
   - Sync process interrupted before completion
   - Partial presence data received
   <!-- Source: Analysis findings from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91005-analysis.md lines 56-59 -->

3. **Synchronization timeout** (10% of cases)
   - Server took too long to send presence data
   - High presence member count causing delays
   - Network latency issues

## Resolution Steps

1. **Wait for automatic recovery**
   - Ably SDKs automatically resynchronize presence when the channel reattaches
   - Monitor the channel state for recovery:
   ```javascript
   channel.on('attached', () => {
     console.log('Channel reattached, presence will resynchronize');
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge base advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91005-knowledge.md lines 31-37 -->

2. **Check synchronization status**
   - Verify presence is synchronized before using the data:
   ```javascript
   if (channel.presence.syncComplete) {
     // Safe to use presence data
     const members = await channel.presence.get();
   } else {
     // Wait for sync to complete
     channel.presence.once('sync', async () => {
       const members = await channel.presence.get();
     });
   }
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge base solution from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91005-knowledge.md lines 49-55 -->

3. **Force resynchronization if needed**
   - For immediate recovery, manually detach and reattach:
   ```javascript
   // Detach the channel
   await channel.detach();
   
   // Reattach to trigger fresh sync
   await channel.attach();
   
   // Wait for sync completion
   channel.presence.once('sync', () => {
     console.log('Presence resynchronized');
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge base recovery pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91005-knowledge.md lines 39-47 -->

4. **Monitor channel state**
   - Implement proper state handling:
   ```javascript
   channel.on('suspended', () => {
     console.log('Channel suspended - presence may be out of sync');
   });
   
   channel.on('attached', () => {
     console.log('Channel attached - presence synchronizing');
   });
   ```

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically handle presence resynchronization:
- When a channel moves from SUSPENDED to ATTACHED state, presence sync is automatically initiated
- The SDK discards the old presence state and fetches a fresh copy from the server
- No manual intervention required for standard recovery scenarios

## Prevention

- **Implement connection monitoring**: Track connection state to anticipate sync issues
- **Use the syncComplete flag**: Always check synchronization status before relying on presence data
- **Handle suspended state**: Implement appropriate UI feedback when channels are suspended
- **Consider caching**: Store last known good presence state for reference during sync issues
