# Error 102106: Room released before operation completed

## What Happened

A Chat room was released while a `rooms.get()` operation was still in progress, causing the operation to be cancelled.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 102106 | 400 | Client Error (Chat SDK) | Yes - after verifying application state |

## Quick Fix

- Check your application's room lifecycle management
- Ensure `rooms.release()` isn't called while `rooms.get()` is pending
- Retry the `rooms.get()` operation if the room is still needed

## Error Messages

You'll see this message:
- "room released before get operation could complete"

## Common Causes

1. **Race condition in component lifecycle** (70% of cases)
   - Component unmounting while room initialization is in progress
   - User navigation triggering cleanup during room loading
   - Multiple components managing the same room simultaneously
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102106-analysis.md lines 45-48 -->

2. **Application shutdown during initialization** (20% of cases)
   - App cleanup running while rooms are being fetched
   - Browser/app closing during async operations
   - Background task cancellation in mobile apps
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102106-knowledge.md lines 99-100 -->

3. **Improper async operation handling** (10% of cases)
   - Not awaiting room operations before cleanup
   - Missing coordination between room get and release calls
   - Parallel operations without proper synchronization
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102106-knowledge.md lines 60-64 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Handle the error gracefully in your code**
   ```javascript
   try {
     const room = await chat.rooms.get('my-room-id');
     // Use the room
   } catch (error) {
     if (error.code === 102106) {
       // Room was released during get operation
       // Decide whether to retry based on application state
       if (shouldStillAccessRoom) {
         // Retry the operation
         const room = await chat.rooms.get('my-room-id');
       } else {
         // Handle gracefully - room is no longer needed
         console.log('Room access cancelled');
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file code example from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102106-knowledge.md lines 102-115, included because essential for demonstrating error handling -->

2. **Improve your room lifecycle management**
   - Implement a centralized room manager to coordinate access
   - Use reference counting for shared room instances
   - Ensure cleanup operations wait for initialization to complete
   - Track pending operations and cancel them appropriately
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102106-knowledge.md lines 117-122 -->

3. **Fix component lifecycle issues (React example)**
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     let cancelled = false;
     let room = null;
     
     async function setupRoom() {
       try {
         const newRoom = await chat.rooms.get('my-room-id');
         if (!cancelled) {
           // Only use room if component is still mounted
           room = newRoom;
           setRoom(newRoom);
         } else {
           // Component unmounted during get - release immediately
           await chat.rooms.release('my-room-id');
         }
       } catch (error) {
         if (error.code === 102106 && !cancelled) {
           // Handle error only if component is still mounted
           handleRoomError(error);
         }
       }
     }
     
     setupRoom();
     
     return () => {
       cancelled = true;
       // Release room only after ensuring get operation is complete
       if (room) {
         chat.rooms.release('my-room-id');
       }
     };
   }, []);
   ```

4. **Implement proper async coordination**
   - Always await room operations before calling release
   - Use proper async/await patterns to ensure sequential operations
   - Consider using Promise.allSettled() for multiple room operations
   - Track operation states to prevent premature cleanup
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file prevention strategies from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102106-knowledge.md lines 60-64 -->

5. **Use platform-specific patterns**
   - **JavaScript**: Leverage AbortController for clean cancellation
   - **Kotlin/Android**: Use coroutines with proper exception handling
   - **Swift/iOS**: Implement actor-based state management
   <!-- Source: Analysis file platform variations from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102106-analysis.md lines 58-62 -->

## Automatic Handling

The Chat SDKs automatically:
- Cancel pending `rooms.get()` operations when `rooms.release()` is called
- Clean up resources to prevent memory leaks
- Log debug information about the cancellation (varies by SDK)
- Comply with the CHA-RC1g4 specification requirement

This error is part of the defensive programming built into the SDK to ensure proper resource cleanup and prevent race conditions.

## Prevention

- **Coordinate room operations**: Avoid calling `rooms.release()` while `rooms.get()` may be in progress
- **Use proper lifecycle management**: Implement cleanup in the correct component lifecycle phase
- **Handle async operations properly**: Always await or properly handle promises
- **Implement room reference counting**: Track active users of a room before releasing
- **Use cancellation tokens**: Implement proper cancellation mechanisms for long-running operations
- **Centralize room management**: Create a singleton room manager to coordinate access across components

## Related Errors

Since this is a Chat SDK-specific error related to room lifecycle management, there are currently no directly related error codes. However, you may encounter other Chat SDK errors in similar scenarios:

• **General Chat SDK errors** - Other errors in the 102xxx range relate to Chat SDK functionality
• **Connection errors** - If the underlying connection fails, you may see 80xxx errors
• **Authentication errors** - Room access may fail with 401xx errors if authentication is invalid
