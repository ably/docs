# Room reactions for chat applications

Use room reactions to enable users to express their feelings within a chat application.

Room reactions enable you to render when another chat user send a reaction to the room. They are most commonly used to display emojis such as a thumbs up (üëç) or a heart (‚ù§Ô∏è).

Room reactions add value to different applications. They enable users to quickly express their feelings about what is happening on screen. One such example is in a live streaming application where users can use the üëç emoji if they're enjoying the content, and watch others react in realtime too.

Room reactions are implemented using [Ably Chat](https://ably.com/docs/products/chat). The Chat SDK contains a set of purpose-built APIs that abstract away the complexities involved in architecting chat features. It is built on top of Ably's core platform, and so it provides the same performance guarantees and scaling potential.

## Resources

// React brief (Only visible if viewing the React example)

Use the following components to add room reactions into a chat application:

* [`ChatClientProvider`](https://ably.com/docs/chat/setup?lang=react#instantiate): initializes and manages a shared chat client instance, passing it down through React context to enable realtime chat functionality across the application.
* [`ChatRoomProvider`](https://ably.com/docs/chat/rooms?lang=react#create): manages the state and functionality of a specific chat room, providing access to messages, participants, and realtime interactions within that room via React context.
* [`useRoom()`](https://ably.com/docs/chat/rooms?lang=react#create) hook: a hook to manage the state and interaction for a chat ‚Äúroom‚Äù, allowing users to join, send messages, listen for messages, and use the other chat functions such as typing indicators.
* [`useRoomReactions()`](https://ably.com/docs/chat/rooms/reactions?lang=react#subscribe) hook: a hook to manage the reactions sent by users within a chat room.

// Javascript brief (Only visible if viewing the Javascript example)

Use the following methods to add room reactions into a chat application:

* [`rooms.get()`](https://ably.com/docs/chat/rooms?lang=javascript#create) - creates a new or retrieves an existing `room`.
* [`rooms.reactions.subscribe()`](https://ably.com/docs/chat/rooms/reactions?lang=javascript#subscribe) - subscribes to room reaction events events by registering a listener. Reaction events are emitted when a user chooses a reaction to send.
* [`room.reactions.send`](https://ably.com/docs/chat/rooms/reactions?lang=javascript#send) - Emits a reaction event when the user chooses a room reaction.
