# Error 1: Unknown error

## What Happened

The SDK encountered an error code from the Ably service that it doesn't recognize, typically indicating a version mismatch between your SDK and the API.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | N/A | Client Error (SDK Deserialization) | No - requires SDK update or investigation |

## Quick Fix

- Update to the latest version of the Rust SDK
- Check the error message field for specific details about the actual error
- Contact Ably support if the error persists after updating

## Error Messages

You may see:
- "Unknown error"

The actual error details from the server are preserved in the message field.

## Common Causes

1. **SDK version mismatch** (most common)
   - Using an older SDK version while the API has introduced new error codes
   - The server returned an error code that your SDK version doesn't recognize
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/1-analysis.md lines 85-89 -->

2. **Beta or experimental features**
   - Accessing features that return error codes not yet in general release
   - Platform-specific error codes for your account
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/1-analysis.md lines 87-88 -->

3. **Corrupted response data**
   - Malformed error responses with invalid error code values
   - Network issues causing response corruption
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/1-analysis.md line 89 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Update your Rust SDK**
   - Check your current version in `Cargo.toml`
   - Update to the latest version: `cargo update -p ably`
   - The latest SDK version will recognize more error codes
   <!-- Source: Knowledge recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/1-knowledge.md lines 62-64 -->

2. **Examine the full error details**
   - The original error message from the server is preserved
   - Log the complete error object for debugging:
   ```rust
   match error.code {
       ErrorCode::UnknownError => {
           // Log the full error for debugging
           log::error!("Unknown error encountered: {:?}", error);
           // The message field contains the actual error details
           println!("Server error: {}", error.message);
       }
       _ => {
           // Handle known error codes
       }
   }
   ```
   <!-- Source: Code example from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/1-knowledge.md lines 95-106 -->

3. **Enable verbose logging**
   - Capture the raw JSON response to see the original error code
   - This helps identify what specific error the server returned
   <!-- Source: Knowledge recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/1-knowledge.md line 89 -->

4. **Check Ably documentation**
   - Review the latest error codes at https://ably.com/docs/errors
   - Look for any recent API changes or new features
   <!-- Source: Knowledge recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/1-knowledge.md line 63 -->

## Automatic Handling

This error code is specific to the Rust SDK's deserialization process. When the SDK receives an unrecognized error code from the server:
- It automatically maps it to error code 1 (UnknownError)
- The original error message and details are preserved
- The SDK continues to function without parsing failures
<!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/1-analysis.md lines 26-28 -->

## Prevention

- Keep your Rust SDK updated to the latest version
- Monitor Ably's changelog for new error codes
- Implement proper error logging to capture full error details
- Use error monitoring to detect unknown errors early
