# Error 91001: Presence operation failed due to invalid channel state

## What Happened

The presence operation could not be completed because the channel is not in a valid state to accept presence updates.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 91001 | 400/500 | Channel State (Presence) | Yes - after channel reattachment |

## Quick Fix

- Ensure the channel is attached before entering presence
- Wait for the channel to reach the `attached` state
- Handle channel state transitions in your application

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "unable to enter presence channel (invalid channel state)"
- "Unable to enter presence channel in detached or failed state"
- "unable to enter presence channel (incompatible channel state: [state])"
- "Unable to enter presence channel in [state] state"
- "Operation is not allowed when channel is in [state]"
- "Operation failed as channel transitioned to [state]"
- "Enter presence on suspended channel"

## Common Causes

1. **Channel not attached** (60% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91001-analysis.md lines 71-78 -->
   - Attempting presence operations before attaching to channel
   - Channel has become detached due to network issues
   - Channel failed during connection problems

2. **Device wake/sleep cycles** (25% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91001-knowledge.md lines 91-98 -->
   - Computer resumes after suspension (especially Windows)
   - Mobile app returns from background
   - Network transitions (WiFi to cellular)

3. **Race conditions** (10% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91001-knowledge.md lines 24-29 -->
   - Channel state changes during presence operation
   - Multiple simultaneous operations on same channel
   - Timing issues during connection recovery

4. **Long-running connections** (5% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91001-knowledge.md lines 139-141 -->
   - Extended disconnection causing channel suspension
   - Connection state not properly managed
   - Missing error recovery logic

## Resolution Steps

1. **Check channel state before presence operations**
   ```javascript
   // Ensure channel is attached before entering presence
   if (channel.state === 'attached') {
     await channel.presence.enter();
   } else {
     // Wait for attachment
     channel.once('attached', async () => {
       await channel.presence.enter();
     });
   }
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91001-knowledge.md lines 50-59 -->

2. **Attach to the channel first**
   ```javascript
   // Proper sequencing: attach then enter presence
   await channel.attach();
   await channel.presence.enter({ name: 'User Name' });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91001-knowledge.md lines 39-48 -->

3. **Handle channel state transitions**
   ```javascript
   channel.on('detached', () => {
     console.log('Channel detached, presence operations will fail');
     // Attempt to reattach
     channel.attach();
   });
   
   channel.on('attached', () => {
     console.log('Channel attached, presence operations now possible');
     // Re-enter presence if needed
     channel.presence.enter();
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91001-analysis.md lines 71-78 -->

4. **Implement recovery for device wake scenarios**
   ```javascript
   // Detect when device wakes from sleep
   document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
     if (!document.hidden) {
       // Check connection and channel states
       if (ably.connection.state !== 'connected') {
         ably.connect();
       }
       // Reattach channels and re-enter presence
       channel.attach(() => {
         channel.presence.enter();
       });
     }
   });
   ```

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs do not automatically retry presence operations when this error occurs. Your application must:
- Monitor channel state
- Reattach to the channel when needed
- Retry presence operations after successful attachment

Some SDKs queue presence operations during the `attaching` state, but will fail if the channel is `detached`, `failed`, or `suspended`.
<!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91001-analysis.md lines 71-83 -->

## Prevention

- Always verify channel state before presence operations
- Implement connection state monitoring
- Handle device sleep/wake events appropriately
- Use channel state event listeners to maintain presence
- Consider implementing automatic re-entry logic after reconnection

## Channel States Reference

Presence operations are only allowed in the `attached` state:

| State | Presence Allowed | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| `initialized` | No | Channel created but not connected |
| `attaching` | Queued | Operations queued until attached |
| `attached` | ✅ Yes | Only state allowing presence |
| `detaching` | No | Channel being removed |
| `detached` | No | Not connected to channel |
| `failed` | No | Channel in error state |
| `suspended` | No | Channel temporarily unavailable |
