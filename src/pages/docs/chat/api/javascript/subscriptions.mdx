## MessageSubscriptionResponse

A response object that allows you to control the subscription to message events.

### Properties

It has the following properties:

| Property | Description | Type |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `unsubscribe` | A method to unsubscribe from message events. | `() => Promise<void>` |

There is a difference between unsubscribing from messages and detaching from a room. Messages are sent to users as soon as they attach to a room, irrespective of whether a listener has been registered by calling `subscribe()`. Unsubscribing only deregisters the listener. The [`detach()`](/docs/chat/api/javascript/room#detach) method detaches a user from the room. At that point a user will no longer receive any messages that are sent to the room.

### Methods

It has the following methods:

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [`historyBeforeSubscribe()`](/docs/chat/api/javascript/messages#historybeforesubscribe) | Get the messages sent before the listener was subscribed. |

### Returned by

It is returned by the following methods:

* [`room.messages.subscribe()`]()/docs/chat/api/javascript/messages#subscribe)

## StatusSubscription

An interface that represents a subscription to status change events. It also provides a method of cleaning up subscriptions that are no longer needed.

### Properties

It has the following properties:

| Property | Description | Type |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `off` | Unsubscribes from the status change events. It will ensure that no further status change events will be sent to the subscriber and that references to the subscriber are cleaned up. | `() => void` |

### Returned by

It is returned by the following methods:

* [`connection.onStatusChange()`](/docs/chat/api/javascript/connection#onstatuschange)
* [`room.onStatusChange()`](/docs/chat/api/javascript/room#onstatuschange)
