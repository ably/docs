  console.log('Serial:', message.serial);
  console.log('From:', message.clientId);
  console.log('Text:', message.text);
  console.log('Sent at:', message.timestamp);
  console.log('Action:', message.action);

  // Check if message has metadata
  if (Object.keys(message.metadata).length > 0) {
    console.log('Metadata:', message.metadata);
  }

  // Check message version for updates or deletions
  if (message.action === ChatMessageAction.MessageUpdate) {
    console.log('Updated by:', message.version.clientId);

  }
});
```
