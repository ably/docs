h5(#support-push). PubNub's support

PubNub seems to provide more extensive and responsive support but does require you to purchase support plans in addition to paying for PubNub’s core service:

* Both ticket-based and web-based chat support
* A comprehensive "support home":https://support.pubnub.com/support/home, knowledge base, and glossary provide ample self-help collateral
* If you’re really struggling PubNub offer a "consultancy-style service":https://www.pubnub.com/services/professional-services
* All pricing tiers include ‘basic support’ which entails ‘best-effort’ response times through email and web. Then there’s premium support plans:

There’s no listed pricing for support plans so we can’t comment on the value.
