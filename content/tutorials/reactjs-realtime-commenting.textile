title: Building a Realtime Commenting App
meta_description: "How to build a realtime commenting app with Ably and React"
meta_keywords: "Ably realtime, React, commenting app"
---

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Ably's "Realtime client library":/basics/use-ably to build a live commenting web app. When a website visitor leaves a comment, you will publish the comment to an Ably channel and also subscribe to that channel to see comments as they are added in realtime.

You will use "React":https://reactjs.org: a component-based, declarative JavaScript library, to build the user interface.

h2. Step 2 - Create a React app

Start by creating a new React app. For simplicity, use "Create React App":https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app, which enables you to create a single-page React app without having to worry about build configurations. 

Install Create React App using @npm@:

```[sh]
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Create a new React app called @reactjs-realtime-commenting@:

```[sh]
create-react-app reactjs-realtime-commenting
```

Test your new React app. First, change into the reactjs-realtime-commenting@ directory:

```[sh]
cd reactjs-realtime-commenting
```

Then, execute @npm start@:

```[sh]
npm start
```

This builds the static site, runs a web server and opens the site in your browser. If your browser does not open, navigate to "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step2

h2. Step 3 - Delete unused files

You won't need the @src/App.css@, @src/App.test.js@, and @src/logo.svg@ files, so delete them: 

```[sh]
rm src/App.css src/App.test.js src/logo.svg
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step3

h2. Step 4 - Create the components folder

Create a new folder within the @src@ folder called @src/components@. This folder will contain all the React components you will build in this tutorial:

```[sh]
mkdir src/components
```

Move the existing @App.js@ file into the @src/components@ folder:

```[sh]
mv src/App.js src/components
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step4

h2. Step 5 - Remove references to unused files

The files you moved or deleted earlier are still referenced by the @src/index.js@ and @src/components/App.js@ files, so you must update these references.

First, update the location of @App@ in @src/index.js@:

```[javascript]
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"  
import "./index.css"
import App from "./components/App" // New location of App.js
import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals"

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
)

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals()
```

Then, replace the contents of @src/components/App.js@ with the following code, which creates a new React component called @App@:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from "react"

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div className="App"></div>
  }
}

export default App
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step5

h2. Step 6 - Add the Bulma CSS framework

Use the "Bulma":https://bulma.io CSS framework so that you can apply some simple styling in a later step. Add the following line to the @<head>@ section of the @public/index.html@ file:

```[html]
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.3/css/bulma.min.css"
/>
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step6

h2. Step 7 - Install and configure the Ably realtime client library

In this step you will install the "Realtime client library":/getting-started/sdks so that you can publish and subscribe to comments in realtime. You will then instantiate it using your API key, and make the instance accessible from multiple places within your application.

**Note**: This tutorial uses "basic authentication":/auth/basic for simplicity. In production applications, Ably recommends that you use "token authentication":/auth/token for browser clients.

First, install the client library:

```[sh]
npm install ably
```

Then, create a file called @.env@ in the root of your application directory and use it to configure your Ably API key:

```[sh]
REACT_APP_ABLY_API_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here
```

Finally, within the @src/components@ folder, create a new file named @Ably.js@ and populate it with the following code:

```[javascript]
import { Realtime } from "ably/browser/static/ably-commonjs.js"

export default new Realtime(process.env.REACT_APP_ABLY_API_KEY)
```


"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step7

h2. Step 8 - Build the comment form

Within the @src/components@ folder, create a new file named @CommentBox.js@ and populate it with the following code:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from "react"

class CommentBox extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1 className="title">Please leave your feedback below</h1>
        <form onSubmit={this.addComment}>
          <div className="field">
            <div className="control">
              <input
                type="text"
                className="input"
                name="name"
                placeholder="Your name"
              />
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="field">
            <div className="control">
              <textarea
                className="textarea"
                name="comment"
                placeholder="Add a comment"
              ></textarea>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="field">
            <div className="control">
              <button className="button is-primary">Submit</button>
            </div>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default CommentBox
```

This component renders a comment form. Submitting the form triggers an @onSubmit@ event which in turn calls @addComment()@, which doesn't exist yet. In the next step you will create the @addComment()@ method.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step8

h2. Step 9 - Publish comments

Within @src/components/CommentBox.js@, add the following code just before the @render()@ method:

```[javascript]
addComment(e) {
  // Prevent the default behaviour of form submit
  e.preventDefault()
  // Get the value of the comment box
  // and make sure it not some empty strings
  const comment = e.target.elements.comment.value.trim()
  const name = e.target.elements.name.value.trim()
  // Get the current time.
  const timestamp = Date.now()
  // Make sure name and comment boxes are filled
  if (name && comment) {
    const commentObject = { name, comment, timestamp }
    // Publish comment
    const channel = Ably.channels.get("comments")
    channel.publish("add_comment", commentObject, (err) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log("Unable to publish message err = " + err.message)
      }
    })
    // Clear input fields
    e.target.elements.name.value = ""
    e.target.elements.comment.value = ""
  }
}
```

The above code:

# Prevents the default form submission behaviour (reloading the page)
# Validates the form inputs
# Publishes valid comments to the @comments@ channel, using the @add_comment@ topic
# Clears the form inputs ready for the next comment

To work with Ably channels and messages, you must access the Ably realtime client library instance you instantiated in @src/components/Ably.js@, so add the following to the list of @import@ statements at the top of the @CommentBox.js@ file:

```[javascript]
import Ably from "./Ably"
```

Then, bind @addComment()@ to the current object instance by adding the following line to the class constructor (just after the call to @super()@):

```[javascript]
this.addComment = this.addComment.bind(this)
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step9

h2. Step 10 - Render a comment

Within the @src/components@ folder, create a new file named @Comment.js@ and add the following code:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Comment extends Component {
  constructor(params) {
    super(params)
    this.messageDate = this.messageDateGet()
  }
  messageDateGet() {
    const date = new Date(this.props.comment.timestamp)
    const dateTimeFormatOptions = {
      year: "2-digit",
      month: "2-digit",
      day: "2-digit",
      hour: "2-digit",
      minute: "2-digit",
    }
    const localeString = date.toLocaleString(undefined, dateTimeFormatOptions)
    return localeString
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <article className="media">
        <figure className="media-left">
          <p className="image is-64x64">
            <img src="https://bulma.io/images/placeholders/128x128.png" alt="Avatar" />
          </p>
        </figure>
        <div className="media-content">
          <div className="content">
            <span className="user-name">{this.props.comment.name} </span>
            <span className="message-date">{this.messageDate}</span>
            <p>{this.props.comment.comment}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </article>
    )
  }
}

export default Comment
```

This component renders a single comment that is supplied to it using props. In React, props are custom attributes that are used to pass data to components. The @messageDateGet()@ function is a utility function for converting the message timestamp into a human-readable date and time format.

Currently, each comment is assigned the same blank placeholder image. You will fix this in the next step.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step10

h2. Step 11 - Add an avatar image

In production you would want to associate a comment with a particular user and display that user's avatar. In this tutorial you will simulate this by assigning a random dog picture from the "Dog API":https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ to each comment. You will use "@axios@":https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios to fetch each image.

First, install @axios@:

```[javascript]
npm install axios
```

and import it in the @CommentBox@ component (@src/components/CommentBox.js@):

```[javascript]
import axios from "axios"
```

Mark the @addComment()@ method as @async@ and replace its contents as shown below. This code makes a HTTP request to the Dog API to retrieve the URL of a random dog picture and stores that URL in an object property called @avatar@:

```[javascript]
// Make the addComment() function asychronous
  async addComment(e) {
    e.preventDefault()
    const comment = e.target.elements.comment.value.trim()
    const name = e.target.elements.name.value.trim()
    const timestamp = Date.now()

    // Retrieve a random image from the Dog API
    const avatar = await (
      await axios.get("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random")
    ).data.message

    if (name && comment) {
      // include the avatar image in the commentObject
      const commentObject = { name, comment, timestamp, avatar }
      console.log(commentObject)

      const channel = Ably.channels.get("comments")
      channel.publish("add_comment", commentObject, (err) => {
        if (err) {
          console.log("Unable to publish message err = " + err.message)
        }
      })
      e.target.elements.name.value = ""
      e.target.elements.comment.value = ""
    }
  }
```

Then, in the @Comment@ component (@src/components/Comment.js@), use this dynamically-generated image instead of the placeholder:

```[javascript]
render() {
  return (
    <article className="media">
      <figure className="media-left">
        <p className="image is-64x64">
          <img alt="dog pic" src={this.props.comment.avatar} />
        </p>
      </figure>
      <div className="media-content">
        <div className="content">
          <span className="user-name">{this.props.comment.name} </span>
          <span className="message-date">{this.messageDate}</span>
          <p>{this.props.comment.comment}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </article>
  )
}
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step11

h2. Step 12 - List all comments

You now need a way to manage all the incoming comments.

Within the @src/components@ folder, create a new @Comments@ component in a file named @Comments.js@, with the following code:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import Comment from './Comment'

class Comments extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <section className="section">
        {
          this.props.comments.map((comment, index) => {
            return <Comment key={comment.timestamp} comment={comment} />
          })
        }
      </section>
    )
  }
}

export default Comments
```

The @Comments@ component accepts a @comments@ props and renders the @Comment@ component once for each comment, using the props data.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step12

h2. Step 13 - Create the App component

The @App@ component will be the parent component for all the other components in your application. Replace the contents of the @src/components/App.js@ file with the following code:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import CommentBox from './CommentBox'
import Comments from './Comments'

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      comments: []
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <section className="section">
        <div className="container">
          <div className="columns">
            <div className="column is-half is-offset-one-quarter">
              <CommentBox />
              <Comments comments={this.state.comments} />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

This contains the @CommentBox@ and @Comments@ components you created earlier. The @comments@ state is an array of comments which is empty by default but updates as users add comments. The @comments@ state is passed as props to the @Comments@ component. This is how the @Comments@ component receives the comments it renders.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step13

h2. Step 14 - Update the application state with new comments

You need to add the new comment to the @App@ component's @state@ so that the list of comments is updated in realtime. Make all the changes in this step to the @src/components/App.js@ file. 

First, add the following code just before the call to @render()@:

```[javascript]
handleAddComment(comment) {
  this.setState(prevState => {
    return {
      comments: [comment].concat(prevState.comments),
    }
  })
}
```

Then, bind @handleAddComment()@ to the @this@ keyword by adding this line to the @constructor()@ just after the call to @super()@:

```[javascript]
this.handleAddComment = this.handleAddComment.bind(this)
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step14

h2. Step 15 - Configure channels to persist messages to disk

You'll use Ably's "history feature":/storage-history/history to persist all comment messages to disk for later retrieval by clients. This capability must be configured on channels using "channel rules":/general/channel-rules-namespaces. In this tutorial you will create a channel rule for all channels in the @persisted@ "namespace":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-a-channel-namespace-and-how-can-i-use-them.

# Visit your "account dashboard":https://faqs.ably.com/how-do-i-access-my-account-dashboard and select the same app you chose in Step 1 when obtaining your API key
# Click on the Settings tab and scroll down to the "Channel rules" section
# Click the "Add new rule" button:
<a href="/images/tutorials/history/channel-rules-add-new-rule.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/history/channel-rules-add-new-rule.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Add new channel rule screenshot">
</a>
# In the "New Channel Rule" dialog box, enter "persisted" for the namespace, check the "Persist all messages" check box to enable history, and click the "Create channel rule" button:
<a href="/images/tutorials/history/channel-rules-create-modal.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/history/channel-rules-create-modal.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Create channel rule screenshot">
</a>

You have now enabled history for all channels in the @persisted@ namespace so that any channel with a name that matches the pattern @persisted:*@ will store published messages to disk.

h2. Step 16 - Display historical comments

Now you need to display the comments. You want these to update in realtime, so you must subscribe to the @comments@ channel and process any incoming messages. 

Even without enabling history, Ably will automatically persist messages for a short period. So when the app loads, we can display any previously persisted comments by using a React lifecycle @componentDidMount()@ hook. In @src/components/App.js@, add the following code just before the @handleAddComment()@ function.

```[javascript]
componentDidMount() {
  const channel = Ably.channels.get("comments")

  channel.attach()
  channel.once("attached", () => {
    channel.history((err, page) => {
      // create a new array with comments in reverse order (old to new)
      const comments = Array.from(page.items, (item) => item.data)
      this.setState({ comments })
      channel.subscribe((msg) => {
        this.handleAddComment(msg.data)
      })
    })
  })
}
```

The @componentDidMount()@ hook runs after the @App@ component is inserted into the DOM. It is a good place to fetch comments from history. The code connects to the @comments@ channel and listens for the @attached@ event. It then updates the application state with the comments pulled from history.

The code then subscribes to new messages on the channel. When a new message is sent on the channel, it uses the message data to add a new comment using @handleAddComment()@.

For this to work you need to import your @Ably@ component. Add the following line to the top of the @src/components/App.js@ file under the other @import@ statements:

```[javascript]
import Ably from "./Ably"
```

Finally, replace the contents of @src/index.css@ with the following CSS, to format the display of the comments:

```[css]
.user-name {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 16px;
}
.message-date {
  font-size: 13px;
  color: #afacac;
}
.user-name + .message-date {
  margin-left: 10px;
}
```

You should now have a realtime commenting system. To test it out, start the app:

```[sh]
npm start
```

Then, open "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000 in two different browser tabs. Add a comment in one of the opened tabs and watch the other tab update with the comment in realtime.

</a>

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step16



h2. Step 17 (optional) – Add a profanity filter

To avoid displaying rude or offensive words that your users might put into comments, you can use a module that filters such words, such as "bad-words":https://www.npmjs.com/package/bad-words. 

First, install the module using @npm@:

```[sh]
npm install bad-words
```

In @src/components@ create new file called @ProfanityFilter.js@ and add the following code:

```[javascript]
import badWords from "bad-words"
const filter = new badWords()

function clean(textToFilter) {
 return filter.clean(textToFilter || '')
}

export default clean
```

This component exports a function which replaces bad words with asterisks (@*@). You can then use it in the comment rendering template for both the name and comment inputs.

In @src/components/Comment.js@ add a new import:

```[javascript]
import filterBadWords from "./ProfanityFilter"
```

In the same file, include the following lines in the @constructor()@ function:

```[javascript]
this.userName = filterBadWords(this.props.comment.name)
this.commentText = filterBadWords(this.props.comment.comment)
```

Then, replace the @render()@ function with the following code:

```[javascript]
render() {
  return (
    <article className="media">
      <figure className="media-left">
        <p className="image is-64x64">
          <img alt="dog pic" src={this.props.comment.avatar} />
        </p>
      </figure>
      <div className="media-content">
        <div className="content">
          <span className="user-name">{this.userName} </span>
          <span className="message-date">{this.messageDate}</span>
          <p>{this.commentText}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </article>
  )
}
```

Run @npm start@ and use your imagination to test that the profanity filter works as expected!
