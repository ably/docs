h2(#setup-ably-account). Step 1 - Set up a free account with Ably

In order to run these tutorials locally, you will need an "Ably API key":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030502-setting-up-and-managing-api-keys. If you are not already signed up, you should "sign up now for a free Ably account":https://www.ably.io/signup.  Once you have an Ably account:

# "Log into your app dashboard":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030053-how-do-i-access-my-app-dashboard
# Under "Your apps", click on "Manage app" for any app you wish to use for this tutorial, or create a new one with the "Create New App" button
# Click on the "API Keys" tab
# Copy the secret "API Key" value from your Root key and store it so that you can use it later in this tutorial
