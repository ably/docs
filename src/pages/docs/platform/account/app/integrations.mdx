Configure webhooks, streaming integrations, and external service connections for your Ably application through the dashboard.

Integrations allow your Ably application to send events to external systems and receive data from external sources, enabling powerful automation and data flow.

## Accessing integrations

To manage your application's integrations:

1. Navigate to your application dashboard
2. Click the Integrations tab
3. Configure webhooks, streaming, and external connections

## Types of integrations

### Webhook integrations

Send Ably events to external HTTP endpoints:

| Webhook Type | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Channel lifecycle | Notify when channels are created, attached, or detached |
| Message events | Send published messages to external services |
| Presence events | Forward presence enter, leave, and update events |
| Connection events | Track client connections and disconnections |

### Streaming integrations

Stream Ably events to external platforms:

| Platform | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Amazon Kinesis | Real-time data streaming to AWS |
| Apache Kafka | High-throughput event streaming |
| Apache Pulsar | Cloud-native messaging system |
| Amazon SQS | Managed message queuing service |
| Google Pub/Sub | Global messaging and event ingestion |

### Function integrations

Process events through serverless functions:

| Platform | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| AWS Lambda | Execute code in response to Ably events |
| Google Cloud Functions | Serverless event processing on Google Cloud |
| Azure Functions | Event-driven serverless compute on Azure |
| Cloudflare Workers | Edge computing for low-latency processing |

## Setting up webhook integrations

### Creating webhook rules

To create a new webhook integration:

1. Click Create new integration on the integrations page
2. Select Webhook as the integration type
3. Configure the webhook settings:
   - Endpoint URL - Where to send the webhook data
   - Event types - Which Ably events to include
   - Channel filter - Limit to specific channels (optional)
   - Headers - Custom HTTP headers for authentication

### Webhook configuration options

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| URL | The endpoint that will receive webhook requests |
| Method | HTTP method (typically POST) |
| Headers | Custom headers for authentication or routing |
| Channel filter | Regular expression to match channel names |
| Event types | Specific events to include in the webhook |

### Webhook security

Secure your webhook endpoints:

- Authentication headers - Include API keys or tokens
- Signature verification - Validate webhook authenticity
- HTTPS endpoints - Ensure encrypted data transmission
- IP whitelisting - Restrict access to known sources

### Testing webhooks

Verify webhook functionality:

1. Test endpoint - Use the built-in testing tool
2. Monitor delivery - Check webhook delivery logs
3. Debug failures - Review error messages and retry attempts
4. Validate payloads - Ensure data format matches expectations

## Configuring streaming integrations

### Setting up streaming rules

To create streaming integrations:

1. Select Streaming from integration types
2. Choose your target platform (Kinesis, Kafka, etc.)
3. Configure connection details:
   - Connection credentials - API keys or connection strings
   - Target configuration - Stream names, topics, or queues
   - Data formatting - Message format and serialization
   - Filtering rules - Which events to stream

### Platform-specific setup

#### Amazon Kinesis integration

Configure Kinesis streaming:

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Region | AWS region for your Kinesis stream |
| Stream name | Target Kinesis stream |
| AWS credentials | Access key and secret for authentication |
| Partition key | How to partition data across shards |

#### Apache Kafka integration

Configure Kafka streaming:

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Bootstrap servers | Kafka cluster connection points |
| Topic name | Target Kafka topic |
| Security protocol | Authentication method (SASL, SSL, etc.) |
| Serialization | Message format (JSON, Avro, etc.) |

### Monitoring streaming integrations

Track streaming performance:

- Throughput metrics - Messages per second streamed
- Delivery rates - Success/failure ratios
- Latency monitoring - Time from Ably event to delivery
- Error tracking - Failed delivery attempts and causes

## Managing integration rules

### Rule configuration

Each integration rule defines:

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Source | Which Ably events trigger the integration |
| Filter | Conditions that must be met for activation |
| Target | Where the event data is sent |
| Format | How the data is structured for delivery |

### Channel filtering

Control which channels trigger integrations:

- All channels - Include events from any channel
- Specific channels - Exact channel name matches
- Pattern matching - Regular expressions for channel names
- Namespace filtering - Include/exclude channel namespaces

### Event filtering

Choose which events to include:

| Event Category | Available Events |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Messages | Published messages with optional content filtering |
| Presence | Enter, leave, update presence events |
| Channels | Channel lifecycle events and occupancy changes |
| Connections | Client connection and disconnection events |

## Integration best practices

### Planning integrations

Before implementing integrations:

1. Map data flow - Understand how data moves between systems
2. Plan for scale - Consider volume and performance requirements
3. Design for reliability - Handle failures and retries gracefully
4. Consider latency - Balance real-time needs with system constraints

### Security considerations

Protect your integrations:

- Secure endpoints - Use HTTPS and proper authentication
- Validate inputs - Check webhook payloads for malicious content
- Rate limiting - Prevent abuse of integration endpoints
- Monitor access - Track integration usage and access patterns

### Performance optimization

Optimize integration performance:

- Batch processing - Group messages for efficiency where possible
- Selective filtering - Send only necessary events to reduce load
- Endpoint optimization - Ensure receiving systems can handle the load
- Monitor latency - Track and optimize end-to-end delivery times

### Error handling

Handle integration failures:

- Retry policies - Configure automatic retry for failed deliveries
- Dead letter queues - Handle permanently failed messages
- Error alerting - Get notified of integration problems
- Fallback strategies - Plan alternative approaches for critical data

## Monitoring and troubleshooting

### Integration logs

Track integration activity:

- Delivery attempts - Success and failure records
- Response codes - HTTP status codes from endpoints
- Retry attempts - Failed delivery retry information
- Performance metrics - Latency and throughput data

### Common issues and solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
| ----- | ----- | -------- |
| Delivery failures | Endpoint unavailable or misconfigured | Check endpoint health and configuration |
| Authentication errors | Invalid credentials or headers | Verify authentication details |
| Rate limiting | Too many requests to endpoint | Implement backoff or reduce frequency |
| Data format errors | Incorrect payload structure | Review and correct data formatting |

### Performance monitoring

Track key metrics:

- Delivery success rate - Percentage of successful deliveries
- Average latency - Time from event to delivery
- Throughput capacity - Maximum events per second
- Error rates - Frequency and types of failures

## Advanced integration scenarios

### Multi-stage processing

Chain integrations for complex workflows:

1. Primary integration - Initial event processing
2. Secondary processing - Additional transformation or routing
3. Final destination - Ultimate data storage or action
4. Error handling - Manage failures at each stage

### Conditional routing

Route events based on content:

- Content-based filtering - Route based on message data
- User-based routing - Different handling for different user types
- Geographic routing - Regional processing of events
- Time-based routing - Different handling based on time of day

### Integration monitoring and alerting

Set up comprehensive monitoring:

- Health checks - Regular verification of integration status
- Performance alerts - Notifications for degraded performance
- Failure notifications - Immediate alerts for integration failures
- Capacity monitoring - Warnings for approaching limits

Integrations enable powerful automation and data flow between Ably and your broader application ecosystem, supporting complex real-time architectures and business processes.
