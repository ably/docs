# Error 100000: Asset Tracking SDK error

## What Happened

The Asset Tracking SDK encountered an internal error while processing your request.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 100000 | N/A | SDK Internal (Asset Tracking) | Depends on error message |

## Quick Fix

- Check the error message for specific details about what went wrong
- Verify your Asset Tracking SDK configuration is complete
- Ensure the publisher or subscriber is in an active state before operations

## Error Messages

You'll see various messages depending on the specific issue:

### Configuration Errors
- "Missing mandatory property: ConnectionConfiguration. Did you forgot to call `connection` on builder object?"
- "Missing mandatory property: TrackingId. Did you forgot to call `trackingId` on builder object?"
- "Missing mandatory property: MapboxConfiguration. Did you forgot to call `mapboxConfiguration` on builder object?"
- "Missing mandatory property: ResolutionPolicyFactory. Did you forgot to call `resolutionPolicyFactory` on builder object?"

### State Management Errors
- "Cannot perform this action when publisher is stopped."
- "Cannot perform this action when subscriber is stopped."
- "Publisher is either stopped or stopping."

### Location Validation Errors
- "Latitude out of range [-90, 90]. Received: ({latitude})"
- "Longitude out of range [-180, 180]. Received: ({longitude})"
- "Invalid horizontal accuracy got {value}"
- "{parameter} must be finite, got {value}"

### Other Common Errors
- "Error while parsing: {object/json}"
- "Attempt to send location while not tracked channel"
- "Provider is already calculating route."

## Common Causes

1. **Incomplete SDK configuration** (40% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100000-analysis.md lines 36-60 -->
   - Missing required configuration parameters
   - Forgetting to call builder methods
   - Invalid connection or authentication setup

2. **Operations on stopped components** (30% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100000-analysis.md lines 89-134 -->
   - Attempting to publish locations after stopping the publisher
   - Trying to track assets with a stopped subscriber
   - Performing actions during shutdown

3. **Invalid location data** (20% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100000-analysis.md lines 168-242 -->
   - Coordinates outside valid ranges
   - Non-finite values (NaN or infinity)
   - Invalid timestamp or accuracy values

4. **JSON serialization issues** (10% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100000-analysis.md lines 136-150 -->
   - Failed encoding/decoding of data
   - Unsupported input types
   - Malformed JSON structures

## Resolution Steps

1. **For configuration errors**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100000-knowledge.md lines 47-50 -->
   - Review your SDK initialization code
   - Ensure all required builder methods are called:
     - `.connection()` for connection configuration
     - `.trackingId()` for subscriber setup
     - `.mapboxConfiguration()` for publisher setup
     - `.resolutionPolicyFactory()` for location resolution
   - Verify your Ably API key is correct

2. **For state management errors**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100000-knowledge.md lines 52-55 -->
   - Check the component state before performing operations
   - Re-initialize stopped publishers or subscribers:
     ```swift
     // Check state before operations
     if publisher.isStopped {
         // Re-initialize or restart the publisher
         publisher = createNewPublisher()
     }
     ```
     <!-- Code source: Based on pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100000-analysis.md lines 89-93 -->

3. **For location validation errors**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100000-knowledge.md lines 57-60 -->
   - Validate location data before sending:
     - Latitude must be between -90 and 90
     - Longitude must be between -180 and 180
     - All numeric values must be finite (not NaN or infinity)
   - Check GPS permissions are granted
   - Handle CoreLocation errors appropriately

4. **For JSON errors**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100000-knowledge.md lines 62-65 -->
   - Validate data structures before serialization
   - Use proper error handling around encoding/decoding
   - Check for unsupported data types

## Automatic Handling

This is an SDK-internal error that requires application-level handling. The Asset Tracking SDK does not automatically retry these errors as they typically indicate configuration or state issues that must be resolved programmatically.

## Prevention

- Initialize SDK components with all required configuration parameters
- Implement proper lifecycle management for publishers and subscribers
- Validate location data before processing
- Use try-catch blocks around Asset Tracking operations
- Maintain awareness of component states (active/stopped)
