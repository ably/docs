Now that we've set up our permissions with Ably, it's time to work on our new Android app. In order for the app to be able to use the Firebase Cloud Messaging service, you'll need to "create an app with FCM":https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup. To do this, follow the following steps:

Firstly make sure you have installed "the latest version of Android Studio":https://developer.android.com/studio, and create a new empty project in Android Studio. In Android Studio, you should then "set up a device":https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device or an "emulator":https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds for testing purposes.

With your empty project ready, you should log in to the "Firebase developer console":https://console.firebase.google.com and create a new project by selecting _Add project_ and following the steps provided.

Once this is done, register your app to this project as shown below, making sure to download the @google-services.json@ and add the appropriate dependencies as described in the process.

Next, go to your project's *Settings* and click on the *Cloud Messaging* tab. You should be able to see your FCM server key as shown below.

Copy this key and paste it in 'Setting up Google/Firebase Cloud Messaging' section under the *Notifications* tab of your Ably app dashboard and click save.
