The Pro package has a monthly fee of $399 plus the number of messages, and channel and connection minutes that you use on top of that. You will be billed for the previous month's consumption.

Note that volume discounts reset every month.

h2(#limits ). Limits

"Compare the limits":/pricing/limits associated with each package to see those available on the Pro package.

h2(#support). Support

Standard package support includes access to Ably support via email with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of less than 1 business day for general guidance and less than 2 business hours for system impediments or system down.

h2(#upgrade). Upgrade

To upgrade your account from a Pro package, "contact us":https://ably.com/contact?cta=enterprise_package to discuss "Enterprise package":/pricing/enterprise options.

h2(#downgrade). Downgrade

To downgrade your account from a Pro package:

1. Ensure you are the "account owner":/account/users.
2. Log in to your "account":https://ably.com/login and select *Billing* from the *Account* menu.
3. Click the *Downgrade* button.

If you downgrade to a "Standard package":/pricing/standard, you will finish the month on the Pro package with its associated limits and benefits. At the beginning of the following month you will receive a final invoice for the Pro package. Subsequent invoices will be for your Standard package.

If you downgrade to a "Free package":/pricing/free, you will finish the month on the Pro package with its associated limits and benefits. At the beginning of the following month you will receive a final invoice covering your last month's consumption. Once the final invoice has been paid, your payment details are removed from the system.

If you wish to cancel your account, downgrade to the Free package first and then have the account owner "contact us":https://ably.com/support. Be aware that this will permanently delete all the information associated with your account.
