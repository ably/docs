Typing indicators enable you to display which users are currently writing a message in a room. This feature can be used to display a message such as __Sandi is typing...__, or when a certain threshold is reached you could instead display __Multiple people are typing...__ or _12 people are typing..._.

h2(#subscribe). Subscribe to typing events

blang[javascript].
  Subscribe to typing events by registering a listener. Typing events can be emitted when a user starts typing, and when they stop typing. Use the "@typing.subscribe()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Typing.html#subscribe method in a room to subscribe to receive these updates:

blang[react].
  Subscribe to typing events with the "@useTyping@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/functions/chat-react.useTyping.html hook. Supply an optional listener to receive the typing events, or use the "@currentlyTyping@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-react.UseTypingResponse.html#currentlyTyping property returned by the hook to access the list of those users that are currently typing.

```[javascript]
const {unsubscribe} = room.typing.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log(event);
});
```

```[react]
import { useTyping } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {currentlyTyping, error } = useTyping({
    listener: (typingEvent: TypingEvent) => {
      console.log('Typing event received: ', typingEvent);
    },
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {error && <p>Typing Error: {error.message}</p>}
      <p>Currently typing: {currentlyTyping.join(', ')}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

h3(#structure). Typing event structure

The following is the structure of a typing event:

```[json]
{
  "currentlyTyping": {
    "clemons",
    "zoranges",
  },
}
```

The following are the properties of a typing event:

|_. Property |_. Description |_. Type |
| currentlyTyping | A set of all users currently typing. | Set |

You can use the size of the @currentlyTyping@ set to decide whether to display individual user names, or that multiple people are typing in your user interface.

h3(#unsubscribe). Unsubscribe from typing events

blang[javascript].
  Unsubscribe from typing events to remove previously registered listeners.

  Use the "@unsubscribe()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.TypingSubscriptionResponse.html#unsubscribe function returned in the @subscribe()@ response to remove a listener:

  ```[javascript]
  // Initial subscription
  const { unsubscribe } = room.typing.subscribe((event) => {
    console.log(`${event.clientId} is currently typing...`);
  });

  // To remove the listener
  unsubscribe();
  ```

  Use the "@typing.unsubscribeAll()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Typing.html#unsubscribeAll method to remove all typing listeners in a room:

  ```[javascript]
  await room.typing.unsubscribeAll();
  ```

blang[react].
  When you unmount the component that is using the @useTyping@ hook, it will automatically handle unsubscribing any associated listeners registered for typing events.

h2(#set). Set typing status

blang[javascript].
  Use the "@typing.start()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Typing.html#start method to emit a typing event with @isTyping@ set to @true@.

blang[react].
  Use the "@start()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-react.UseTypingResponse.html#start method available from the response of the @useTyping@ hook to emit an event when a user has started typing.

There is a timeout associated with start events. A stop event will be automatically emitted after it expires if one isn't received before the timeout. The length of this timeout is customizable using the @timeoutMs@ parameter that can be configured in the @RoomOptions@ that you set when you "create a room":/chat/rooms#create. The default is 10000ms.

```[javascript]
await room.typing.start();
```

```[react]
import { useTyping } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { start, currentlyTyping, error } = useTyping();
  const handleStartClick = () => {
    start();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {error && <p>Typing Error: {error.message}</p>}
      <button onClick={handleStartClick}>Start Typing</button>
      <p>Currently typing: {currentlyTyping.join(', ')}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

blang[javascript].
  Use the "@stop()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Typing.html#stop method to emit a typing event with @isTyping@ set to @false@.

blang[react].
  Use the "@stop()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-react.UseTypingResponse.html#stop method available from the response of the @useTyping@ hook to emit an event when a user has stopped typing.

```[javascript]
await room.typing.stop();
```

```[react]
import { useTyping } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { stop, error } = useTyping();
  const handleStopClick = () => {
    stop();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {error && <p>Typing Error: {error.message}</p>}
      <button onClick={handleStopClick}>Stop Typing</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

h2(#retrieve). Retrieve a list of users that are currently typing

blang[javascript].
  Use the "@typing.get()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Typing.html#get method to retrieve a set of @clientId@s for all users that are currently typing in the room:

  ```[javascript]
  const currentlyTypingClientIds = await room.typing.get();
  ```

blang[react].
  Use the "@currentlyTyping@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-react.UseTypingResponse.html#currentlyTyping property available from the response of the @useTyping@ hook to view a list of all users that are currently typing in the room.
