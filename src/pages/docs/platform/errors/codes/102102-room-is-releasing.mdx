# Error 102102: Room is Releasing

## What Happened?

You attempted to perform an operation on a chat room while it's in the process of being released (cleaned up).

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 102102 | 400 | Client Error (Chat SDK) | No - must wait for release to complete |

## Quick Fix

- Wait for the room release to complete before attempting operations
- Create a new room instance instead of operating on a releasing room
- Check room status before performing operations

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "cannot [operation] room, room is currently releasing" (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- "Cannot perform operation because the room is in a releasing state" (Swift)

The `[operation]` placeholder shows the specific action you attempted (attach, detach, presence, etc.).

## Common Causes

1. **Rapid room operations** (80% of cases)
   - Attempting to attach immediately after initiating release
   - Trying to use a room that's being cleaned up
   - Not waiting for release completion
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-analysis.md lines 40-43 -->

2. **Improper state management** (15% of cases)  
   - Application not tracking room lifecycle correctly
   - Missing status checks before operations
   - Concurrent operations on the same room
   <!-- Source: Knowledge insights from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md lines 66-70 -->

3. **Race conditions** (5% of cases)
   - Multiple parts of application accessing room during release
   - Asynchronous operations overlapping with release
   - Parallel operations not coordinated properly
   <!-- Source: Technical analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md lines 68-69 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Check room status before operations**
   <!-- Source: Developer guidance from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md lines 88-94 -->
   Verify the room state before attempting any operations:
   ```javascript
   // ✅ Correct: Check status first
   if (room.status !== 'releasing' && room.status !== 'released') {
     await room.attach();
   }
   
   // ❌ Wrong: Operating without checking
   await room.attach(); // May throw 102102
   ```
   <!-- Code source: https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md lines 89-93, essential for demonstrating proper state checking -->

2. **Wait for release to complete**
   <!-- Source: Implementation guidance from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md lines 96-103 -->
   Listen for status changes and wait for the room to be fully released:
   ```javascript
   room.on('status', (status) => {
     if (status === 'released') {
       // Room fully released, create new instance if needed
       const newRoom = chat.rooms.get(roomId);
     }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Code source: https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md lines 97-102, demonstrates status monitoring pattern -->

3. **Create a new room instance**
   <!-- Source: Recovery approach from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md lines 112-113 -->
   Instead of waiting, immediately create a fresh room instance:
   ```javascript
   // Release old room
   await oldRoom.release();
   
   // Create new instance with same ID
   const newRoom = chat.rooms.get(roomId);
   await newRoom.attach();
   ```
   <!-- Code source: Recovery pattern based on https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md lines 112-113 -->

4. **Implement proper lifecycle management**
   <!-- Source: Prevention strategies from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md lines 105-110 -->
   Ensure graceful shutdown sequence:
   - Complete all pending operations
   - Initiate release
   - Wait for release completion
   - Only then create new instances if needed

5. **Queue operations for later execution**
   <!-- Source: Recovery approach from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md line 114 -->
   Buffer operations during release and execute after completion:
   ```javascript
   const pendingOperations = [];
   
   room.on('status', (status) => {
     if (status === 'attached') {
       // Execute queued operations
       pendingOperations.forEach(op => op());
       pendingOperations.length = 0;
     }
   });
   ```

## Automatic Handling

The Ably Chat SDKs enforce this validation to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency. This is a protective mechanism implementing the CHA-RL1b and CHA-RL2b specifications for room lifecycle management. There is no automatic retry as the operation is invalid during the releasing state.
<!-- Source: Technical details from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-analysis.md lines 29, 35, 40-43 -->

## Prevention

- **Always check room status** before performing operations
- **Implement proper state tracking** in your application  
- **Use event listeners** to monitor room lifecycle changes
- **Avoid rapid create/release cycles** on the same room
- **Coordinate parallel operations** to prevent conflicts
- **Handle cleanup gracefully** with proper sequencing
<!-- Source: Prevention strategies from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/102102-knowledge.md lines 88-110 -->

## Performance Impact

This error indicates a transient state that typically resolves quickly. The release process usually completes within milliseconds to seconds, depending on network conditions and the number of active connections to the room. The error itself has minimal performance impact as it's a client-side validation that prevents invalid operations.
