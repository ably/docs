# Error 40164: API key missing revocable tokens attribute

## What Happened

Your API key doesn't have the required `revocableTokens` attribute needed to revoke tokens. Token revocation is a privileged operation that must be explicitly enabled on API keys.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40164 | 401 | Client Error (Authentication) | No - requires API key configuration change |

## Quick Fix

- Enable the `revocableTokens` attribute on your API key in the Ably dashboard
- Generate a new API key with revocation capabilities enabled
- Use an existing key that already has the `revocableTokens` attribute

## Error Messages

You'll see this message:
- "Can only revoke tokens issued from a key with the revocableTokens attribute set"

## Common Causes

1. **API key created without revocation capability** (90% of cases)
   - Standard key generation doesn't include revocation by default
   - Key was created before token revocation feature was needed
   - Automated key creation process missing this attribute
   <!-- Source: Based on knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40164-knowledge.md lines 15-22 -->

2. **Using legacy API keys** (8% of cases)
   - Keys created before revocation feature existed
   - Keys migrated from older account configurations
   <!-- Source: Based on knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40164-knowledge.md lines 9-10 -->

3. **Feature not available on account plan** (2% of cases)
   - Token revocation may require specific account features
   - Advanced security features pending enablement
   <!-- Source: Based on knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40164-knowledge.md lines 25-29 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Check your current API key configuration**
   - Log into your [Ably dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard)
   - Navigate to your app → "API Keys" tab
   - Look for the `revocableTokens` attribute on your key
   - Note if the attribute is present and enabled
   <!-- Source: Resolution approach from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40164-knowledge.md lines 39-43 -->

2. **Enable revocation capability on existing key** (if supported)
   - Click "Edit" on your API key
   - Look for the `revocableTokens` option
   - Enable the attribute if available
   - Save the configuration changes
   - Test token revocation with the updated key
   <!-- Source: Resolution approach from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40164-knowledge.md lines 45-50 -->

3. **Create a new API key with revocation enabled**
   - Navigate to "API Keys" → "Create new key"
   - Enable the `revocableTokens` attribute during creation
   - Set other required capabilities (publish, subscribe, etc.)
   - Save the new key credentials securely
   - Update your application to use the new key
   <!-- Source: Resolution approach from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40164-knowledge.md lines 52-57 -->

4. **Verify token revocation works**
   - Test your token revocation implementation
   - Confirm tokens are successfully revoked
   - Monitor for any further 40164 errors
   <!-- Source: Resolution approach from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40164-knowledge.md lines 59-63 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a configuration error that cannot be automatically resolved. You must update your API key configuration to include the `revocableTokens` attribute before token revocation operations will succeed.

## Prevention

To avoid this error in the future:

- **Plan key capabilities upfront**: Identify all required attributes when creating API keys
- **Use key templates**: Create templates for different use cases with appropriate attributes
- **Document key purposes**: Maintain documentation of which keys have which capabilities
- **Regular audits**: Review API key configurations periodically
<!-- Source: Prevention strategies from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40164-knowledge.md lines 67-72 -->

## Performance Impact

When using revocable tokens:
- Initial connections and REST requests may incur a small latency cost
- The token revocation API is rate-limited per application
- Maximum global aggregate rate is configurable by Ably at the application level

## Security Context

This error is part of Ably's token revocation security framework, which validates:
1. First checks if the key attempting revocation matches the issuing key (error 40133)
2. Then verifies the key has the `revocableTokens` attribute enabled (error 40164)
3. This implements attribute-based access control for privileged operations

## Alternative Approaches

If token revocation isn't available on your account:

- **Use shorter token TTL**: Configure tokens with brief lifetimes instead of relying on revocation
- **Implement token refresh**: Use regular token renewal patterns
- **Restrict capabilities**: Issue tokens with minimal necessary permissions
- **Application-level sessions**: Manage user sessions without relying on token revocation
