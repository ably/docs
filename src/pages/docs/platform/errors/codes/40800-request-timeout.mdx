# Error 40800: Request timeout

## What Happened

Your request to Ably didn't complete within the allowed time limit, resulting in a timeout.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40800 | 408 | Client Error (Network) | Yes - temporary network issue |

## Quick Fix

- Check your network connectivity to Ably endpoints
- Verify firewall rules aren't blocking connections
- Consider network latency in your region

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Request timed out"
- "Unable to ping service; Request timed out"

## Common Causes

1. **Network connectivity issues** (60% of cases)
   - High network latency between client and Ably
   - Intermittent packet loss
   - Network congestion
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 9-13 -->

2. **Firewall or proxy interference** (25% of cases)
   - Corporate firewall blocking WebSocket connections
   - Proxy server introducing delays
   - DNS resolution timeouts
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 89-91 -->

3. **Server processing delays** (15% of cases)
   - Temporary server load conditions
   - Large payload processing
   - Queue system overload
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 15-22 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify network connectivity**
   - Test connectivity to Ably endpoints (rest.ably.io, realtime.ably.io)
   - Check for packet loss or high latency using network diagnostic tools
   - Ensure your internet connection is stable
   <!-- Source: Knowledge recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 89-90 -->

2. **Review firewall and proxy settings**
   - Ensure WebSocket connections are allowed (port 443)
   - Verify Ably domains are whitelisted
   - Check proxy timeout settings if applicable
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 89-90 -->

3. **Adjust timeout configuration (if available)**
   - Some SDKs allow configuring timeout values
   - Increase timeout for high-latency environments
   - Balance between responsiveness and reliability
   <!-- Source: Knowledge recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 29-31 -->

4. **Monitor for patterns**
   - Check if timeouts occur at specific times
   - Look for correlation with network events
   - Track timeout frequency to identify systemic issues
   <!-- Source: Knowledge recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 37-39 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs implement automatic retry logic for timeout errors:
- The SDK will retry the request with appropriate backoff
- Connection recovery mechanisms handle transient network issues
- You don't need to implement manual retry logic for most timeout scenarios
<!-- Source: Analysis of SDK behavior from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40800-analysis.md lines 60-62 -->

## Prevention

- **Monitor network quality**: Regularly check connection quality to Ably endpoints
- **Configure appropriate timeouts**: Set timeout values based on your network conditions
- **Use connection state listeners**: Monitor connection state to detect issues early
- **Implement fallback strategies**: Have contingency plans for degraded network conditions
