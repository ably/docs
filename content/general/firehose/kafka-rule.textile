You can use a Kafka rule to send "data":/general/firehose#data-sources such as messages, occupancy, lifecycle and presence events from Ably to Kafka.

If you want to send data from Kafka to Ably, you can use the "Ably Kafka Connector":/general/kafka-connector, rather than Kafka rules.

In this section you need to set up your Authentication for Kafka by selecting your preferred mechanism for authentication and providing credentials. 

The supported Authentication Mechanisms are: 

* "SASL/PLAIN":https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/authentication_sasl/authentication_sasl_plain.html#kafka-sasl-auth-plain
* "SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256":https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/authentication_sasl/authentication_sasl_scram.html#kafka-sasl-auth-scram
* "SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512":https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/authentication_sasl/authentication_sasl_scram.html

7. Click *Create* to create the rule.

h3(#creating-rule-control-api). Creating a Kafka rule using Control API

See some examples of creating rules in the "rules section":/account/control-api#examples-rules of the Control API documentation. You can also refer to the "rule section":/api/control-api#tag/rules/paths/~1apps~1{app_id}~1rules/post of the Control API Reference for information on creating a Kafka rule. You will need to select a @ruleType@ of @kafka@.
