meta_description: "Ably supports two main authentication schemes: client-side and server-side authentication. Client-side authentication can be implemented using JWTs, Ably tokens, and Ably token requests. Server-side authentication can be implemented using Ably API keys."

Before a client or server can issue requests to Ably, such as subscribe to channels, or publish messages, it must authenticate with Ably. Authentication requires an Ably API key.

h2(#auth-choice). Client-side vs server-side authentication

When making requests to Ably, you can authenticate either as a client or as a server. This important choice depends on the type of request you are making:

h3(#client-side). Client-side authentication

Client-side applications require you to use an authentication method with more security in mind than server-side authentication. The reason for this is that client-side applications are more exposed to potential attackers as they are accessed through the browser or mobile application of the user. Client-side authentication methods consist of JWT tokens or an Ably authentication token. The preferred method of authentication method in this instance is to use JWT, and the rest of this page will discuss client-side authentication using JWT.

h3(#server-side). Server authentication

Server-side applications require you to primarily use your Ably API key. This is because server-side applications are less exposed to potential attackers as they are not accessed through the browser or mobile application of the user. Restrictions with this

h2(#identification). Identification with clientIds

An authenticated client is one that has successfully connected to Ably, but it does not necessarily have an identity. A client is considered identified when assigned a trusted `clientId`, which is automatically included in all interactions with Ably and can be trusted by other clients. For example, in a chat application, if each client is assigned a unique `clientId` (such as an email or UUID) by your server, other clients can trust that messages and presence events originate from the assigned identity. Ably enforces this by preventing clients from using a `clientId` they are not explicitly assigned in their token.
