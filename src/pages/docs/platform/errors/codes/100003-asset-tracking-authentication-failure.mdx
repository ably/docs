# Error 100003: Asset Tracking authentication failure

## What Happened

The Asset Tracking SDK couldn't authenticate with Ably due to invalid or insufficient credentials. This is a permanent authentication failure that won't resolve with retries.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 100003 | 403 | Authentication (Asset Tracking) | No - requires fixing credentials |

## Quick Fix

- Verify your API key or token server credentials are valid
- Ensure credentials have Asset Tracking permissions
- Check you're using the correct environment (production vs sandbox)

## Error Messages

You'll see this message:
- "Token auth non-retriable failure"

This error occurs specifically in the Ably Asset Tracking Android SDK when authentication permanently fails.

## Common Causes

<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100003-analysis.md lines 25-30 and Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100003-knowledge.md lines 92-131 -->

1. **Invalid API key configuration** (Most common)
   - Using an expired or revoked API key
   - Copy-paste errors in the API key string
   - Using test credentials in production

2. **Insufficient token permissions**
   - Token lacks Asset Tracking channel capabilities
   - Missing publish or presence permissions
   - Token server not configured with correct permissions

3. **Token server credential issues**
   - Token server using invalid Ably credentials
   - Wrong application ID in token generation
   - Environment variables not properly configured

4. **Environment mismatch**
   - Using sandbox credentials for production resources
   - Using production credentials for sandbox resources

## Resolution Steps

<!-- Source: Resolution patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100003-knowledge.md lines 92-131 -->

1. **Verify your API key**
   - Log into your [Ably dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard)
   - Navigate to your app â†’ "API Keys" tab
   - Copy the complete API key (including the app ID prefix)
   - Replace the invalid key in your Asset Tracking configuration

2. **Check token server configuration**
   - Verify the API key used by your token server is valid
   - Ensure the token includes Asset Tracking channel permissions
   - Test token generation independently before SDK initialization
   <!-- Source: Based on token server architecture recommendations from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100003-knowledge.md lines 136-148 -->

3. **Validate environment configuration**
   - Confirm you're using the correct Ably application (production vs sandbox)
   - Verify environment-specific configuration is properly deployed
   - Check that credential environment variables are correctly set

4. **Test authentication separately**
   - Use the Ably dashboard's API Streamer to test your credentials
   - Verify basic channel publish/subscribe works with your credentials
   - Once confirmed, retry Asset Tracking SDK initialization

## Automatic Handling

The Asset Tracking SDK does not automatically retry this error. Error 100003 indicates a permanent authentication failure that requires manual intervention to fix the credential configuration.

## Prevention

<!-- Source: Prevention strategies from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100003-knowledge.md lines 132-154 -->

- **Credential validation**: Test credentials during development and in CI/CD pipelines
- **Environment management**: Use separate credentials for each environment
- **Secure storage**: Store credentials in secure systems like AWS Secrets Manager
- **Regular rotation**: Implement credential rotation procedures
- **Health monitoring**: Add authentication health checks to your token server
