# Error 40149: Token error range boundary

## What Happened

Your authentication token encountered an issue at the boundary of Ably's token error classification range (40140-40149).

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40149 | 401 | Authentication (Token) | Yes - after token refresh |

## Quick Fix

- Refresh your authentication token immediately
- Verify the new token has proper permissions
- Reconnect with the fresh token

## Error Messages

You may see error messages similar to:
- "Token error (range 40140-40149)"
- HTTP 401 response with error code 40149
- Authentication failure at token range boundary

## Common Causes

1. **Token validation boundary issue** (Most common)
   - Token validation failed at the edge of the error range
   - Authentication system classified the error at range boundary
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40149-analysis.md lines 23-36 -->

2. **SDK error classification** 
   - SDK identified a token-related authentication failure
   - Error fell within the recoverable token error range (40140-40149)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40149-analysis.md lines 31-34 -->

3. **Token lifecycle event**
   - Token expired or became invalid
   - Authentication failure requiring token refresh
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40149-knowledge.md lines 19-23 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Identify the specific token issue**
   - Check for more detailed error information in your logs
   - Look for specific error codes within the 40140-40149 range
   - Review the complete authentication context
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40149-knowledge.md lines 31-35 -->

2. **Refresh your authentication token**
   - Request a new token from your authentication endpoint
   - Ensure the new token has the required capabilities
   - Verify token generation is working correctly
   <!-- Source: Analysis metadata from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40149-analysis.md line 51 -->

3. **Reconnect with the new token**
   - Close the current connection
   - Create a new connection with the fresh token
   - Verify successful authentication
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from internal discussions https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40149-knowledge.md lines 125-129 -->

4. **Implement proper error handling**
   - Set up automatic token refresh for errors in the 40140-40149 range
   - Monitor authentication failures
   - Log token refresh attempts for debugging
   <!-- Source: Knowledge best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40149-knowledge.md lines 131-137 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically recognize errors in the 40140-40149 range as recoverable token issues and will:
- Attempt to refresh the token if a token callback is configured
- Not treat these as permanent authentication failures
- Allow reconnection once a valid token is obtained
<!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40149-analysis.md lines 59-62 -->

## Prevention

- **Implement token lifecycle management**: Set up automatic token refresh before expiration
- **Monitor token validity**: Track token expiration times and refresh proactively
- **Use token callbacks**: Configure your SDK with a callback that provides fresh tokens
- **Handle the 40140-40149 range**: Implement specific error handling for token errors
