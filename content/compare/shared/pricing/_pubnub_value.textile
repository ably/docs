PubNub charges over four categories. The scheme is quite complex.

PubNub offers a $45 monthly plan, which is said to be ‘prepaid toward your transaction usage’. Transactions are priced as follows:

* $0.000075 per *Replicated Transaction* (i.e. API calls that result in information replicating across multiple PubNub Points-of-Presence, a concept also known as a ‘message’).
* $0.000020 is the price of an *Edge Transaction* (i.e. API calls that interact with a single PubNub PoP, such as receiving a published message via a Subscribe API call).
* $0.000025 per *Functions Execution* (each execution of a PubNub function).
* $8 per *GB Data Persistence* (data calls that store data into PubNub - this could be Storage & Playblack, the Key/ Value store, and others).

Here’s what the scheme looks like in table form on PubNub’s site:

PubNub lets you pay for the resources you use in a package format. However, "pricing is based on transactions which are classified into more than 40 different types":https://www.pubnub.com/docs/transaction-classification, making it difficult to predict ongoing costs. In addition to being complicated, PubNub tends to "price higher":https://www.quora.com/Why-is-PubNub-so-expensive-compare-to-Pusher-or-Firebase than other providers.
