A required service is temporarily unavailable, preventing Ably from processing your request.

| Error code | HTTP status code | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 50300 | 503 | Server error (Service) | Yes |

## Error messages

The following error messages can be returned with error code 50300:

| Message | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Service Unavailable | The general service unavailability message. |
| failed to make request: [details] | Moderation service communication failure with specific error details. |
| Active Traffic Management: traffic is being temporarily redirected to a backup service | Traffic redirection during infrastructure events. |

## Impact

This error impacts the current operation and may temporarily prevent:

- Messages from being moderated before delivery.
- Normal routing of requests through Ably's infrastructure.
- API operations from completing successfully.

Ably SDKs automatically retry service unavailability errors with appropriate backoff strategies. The service typically recovers within seconds to minutes.

## Troubleshooting

The following are common causes and how to resolve them for error 50300:

### Moderation service unavailable

{/* Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/50300-analysis.md lines 15-21 */}

| Error messages |
| -------------- |
| failed to make request: [details] |

This occurs when:

- Ably's realtime servers cannot communicate with external moderation services.
- Network connectivity issues prevent reaching the moderation service.
- The moderation service is experiencing downtime or high load.

To resolve this:

- The SDK will automatically retry with exponential backoff.
- Check the [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) for any service disruptions.
- If using Chat features with moderation enabled, messages will be retried once service connectivity is restored.

### Active Traffic Management

{/* Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/50300-knowledge.md lines 69-90 */}

| Error messages |
| -------------- |
| Active Traffic Management: traffic is being temporarily redirected to a backup service |
| Service Unavailable |

This occurs when:

- Ably infrastructure is actively redirecting traffic to backup clusters.
- Planned maintenance or emergency failover is in progress.
- Regional infrastructure experiences issues requiring traffic redirection.

To resolve this:

- Your SDK will automatically handle the redirection to alternate endpoints.
- No manual intervention is required - the SDK manages failover transparently.
- Monitor the [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) for updates on the infrastructure event.

### Routing layer unavailable

{/* Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/50300-knowledge.md lines 33-47 */}

| Error messages |
| -------------- |
| Service Unavailable |

This occurs when:

- Ably's routing layer cannot service the request.
- Infrastructure components are temporarily unavailable.
- Generic service unavailability when a more specific error code doesn't apply.

To resolve this:

- Allow the SDK's automatic retry mechanism to handle recovery.
- Check the [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) for infrastructure status.
- If the error persists beyond 2 minutes, contact support with the error details.
