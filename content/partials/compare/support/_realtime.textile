h5(#support-realtime). Realtime.co's support

In all honesty, Realtime.co is pretty light on the level of support it offers:

* None of the pricing tiers mention anything about support
* There’s no live chat
* Email support didn’t respond
* There’s no obvious community support

*And, as of late January 2019, the support page/documentation returns a 404 error from Intercom. It’s not clear whether this is a temporary issue or not. But combined with out of date documentation, it doesn’t bode well if you’re trusting the integrity of your realtime service to Realtime.co.*
