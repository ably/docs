LiveSync enables you to synchronize changes in your database to frontend clients at scale. LiveSync is database agnostic but currently only supports "PostgreSQL":https://www.postgresql.org/ in its early access version. It uses Ably's global message delivery network to sync user data in realtime.
LiveSync is made up of two key components:

- "Database Connector":/livesync/connector := a backend service for broadcasting changes from your database in realtime.
- "Models SDK":/livesync/models/models  := a frontend library that simplifies subscribing to changes in data models and applying optimistic updates, merging them with confirmed updates.

The following diagram provides a simplified overview of the LiveSync solution:

h2(#db-connector). Database Connector

The "Database Connector":/livesync/connector uses the "outbox pattern":https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/transactional-outbox.html to broadcast application-specific change events from your database to frontend clients via Ably "channels":/channels.

When you update the data in your database, you record a change event transactionally in a dedicated "outbox table":https://docs.google.com/document/d/19BJ4oYC3ah4wFH0VS5Qv6qHe3qmRS_PpNLSytTOi9tc/edit#heading=h.r00ywdkts746. The outbox changes are detected by the Database Connector, which then publishes them as messages on channels. Using the "Models SDK":/livesync/models/models, your client applications subscribe to these change events and update their local state with the new data.

<p>The Database Connector is currently a "Docker container image":https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#containers that can run on your own infrastructure. Please "reach out":https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd00n1uxgXWPGvMjKwMVL1UDhFKMeh3bSrP52j9AfXifoU-Pg/viewformif you have any feedback or prefer to use an Ably-hosted version of LiveSync.</p>

h2(#models-sdk). Models SDK

The "Models SDK":/livesync/models/models enables you to easily create live and observable data models in your frontend applications, ensuring they remain synchronized with your database's state in realtime. By subscribing to a model, you receive the changes made by other users, enabling the creation of a seamless, multiplayer application experience.

The Models SDK works as follows:

- "Sync":/livesync/models/models#sync := bootstraps the client state during the initial page load.
- "Merge":/livesync/models/models#merge := updates the client state in response to realtime change events.
- "Optimistic updates":/livesync/models/models#optimistic := provides instantaneous feedback to the user when they change the data.
- "Subscribe":/livesync/models/models#subscribe := renders changes to the model state in your application in realtime.

The Models SDK is built on "Ably's JavaScript SDK":https://github.com/ably/ably-js and can be easily integrated into any front-end framework. The key advantages include:

* "Authentication":/auth and "connection management":/connect are efficiently managed by the underlying Ably JavaScript SDK.

* The Ably JavaScript SDK enables you to extend your application's functionality with "Pub/Sub Channels":/products/channels.

h2(#dev-status). Development status

LiveSync is currently in the early release stage, primarily intended for experimental use and not yet suitable for production environments. Your "feedback":https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd00n1uxgXWPGvMjKwMVL1UDhFKMeh3bSrP52j9AfXifoU-Pg/viewform will help in prioritizing improvements and fixes in subsequent releases.
