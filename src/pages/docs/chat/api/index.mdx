This section of the documentation contains the API references for Ably Chat.

## Chat SDKs <a id="sdks" />

The following API references are available. They are automatically generated from source code:

* [JavaScript](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/modules/chat-js.html)
* [React Hooks](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/modules/chat-react.html)
* [Kotlin (JVM & Android)](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-kotlin/main/dokka/)
* [Swift](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-swift/main/AblyChat/documentation/ablychat/)

## REST API <a id="rest-api" />

A raw [REST API](/docs/api/chat-rest) is also provided - you don't need to install any SDK to use this. This is used where an Ably Chat SDK is not available for your chosen platform, or you don't wish to use an SDK due to resource constraints.

## Further information <a id="further-information" />

In addition to the API references listed, Ably's documentation provides information on how these interfaces are used. This includes key concepts such as connections, chat rooms, messages and typing indicators. You can find that information on the following pages:

* [About Ably Chat](/docs/chat)
* [Getting Started with Ably Chat](/docs/chat/getting-started)
* [Chat SDK Setup](/docs/chat/setup)
* [React UI Kit Overview](/docs/chat/react-ui-kit)
