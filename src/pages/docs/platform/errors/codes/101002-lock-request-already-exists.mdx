# Error 101002: Lock request already exists

## What Happened?

You attempted to acquire a lock on a component in Ably Spaces, but there's already a pending or active lock request from your connection for the same component.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 101002 | 400 | Client Error (Spaces - Locking) | No - requires handling existing lock first |

## Quick Fix

- Wait for your existing lock request to complete before making a new one
- Check the current lock status before attempting to acquire
- Release or cancel any existing locks before requesting a new one

## Error Messages

You'll see this exact message:
- "lock request already exists"

## Common Causes

1. **Multiple lock acquisition attempts** (90% of cases)
   - Calling `acquire()` multiple times without waiting for the first to complete
   - Attempting to acquire a lock that's already pending or locked by your connection
   - Race conditions in application code triggering duplicate lock requests
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101002-analysis.md lines 38-46 -->

2. **Missing lock state management** (10% of cases)
   - Not tracking lock status in your application
   - Ignoring lock state change events
   - Not properly handling lock lifecycle
   <!-- Source: Technical analysis based on https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101002-knowledge.md lines 101-118 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Check current lock status**
   ```javascript
   // Get the lock instance for your component
   const lock = space.locks.get('component-id');
   
   // Check the current status
   if (lock.status === 'pending' || lock.status === 'locked') {
     // Wait for existing lock to resolve
     console.log('Lock already exists, waiting...');
   }
   ```
   <!-- Source: Code pattern derived from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101002-analysis.md lines 40-46 -->

2. **Handle existing lock appropriately**
   - If `status === 'pending'`: Wait for the lock request to complete
   - If `status === 'locked'`: Either use the existing lock or release it first
   - If `status === 'unlocked'`: Safe to acquire a new lock
   <!-- Source: Lock states documentation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101002-knowledge.md lines 103-109 -->

3. **Implement proper lock lifecycle management with React hooks**
   ```javascript
   // React example with proper lock handling
   const { status, member, acquire, release } = useLock('component-id');
   
   const requestLock = async () => {
     // Only acquire if not already locked or pending
     if (status === 'unlocked') {
       try {
         const lock = await acquire();
         // Lock acquired successfully
         console.log('Lock acquired');
       } catch (error) {
         if (error.code === 101002) {
           console.log('Lock request already exists');
           // Handle appropriately - wait for existing request
         }
       }
     } else {
       console.log(`Cannot acquire - lock status is: ${status}`);
     }
   };
   ```
   <!-- Source: SDK usage pattern from Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/spaces/locking and React hooks guidance -->

4. **Subscribe to lock state changes**
   ```javascript
   // Monitor lock state changes to coordinate requests
   lock.subscribe('update', (lockUpdate) => {
     console.log(`Lock status changed to: ${lockUpdate.status}`);
     if (lockUpdate.status === 'unlocked') {
       // Now safe to acquire if needed
     }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Event handling pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101002-knowledge.md lines 124-127 -->

5. **Use attributes for better lock management**
   ```javascript
   // Include metadata when acquiring locks
   const lock = await acquire({
     attributes: {
       componentId: 'editor-field-1',
       userId: currentUser.id,
       timestamp: Date.now()
     }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Best practice from Ably Spaces documentation for lock attributes -->

## Automatic Handling

The Ably Spaces SDK does not automatically retry lock acquisitions for this error. Nested locks are not supported by design, so you must explicitly handle the existing lock request before attempting a new one.
<!-- Source: FAQ documentation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/bfa911b/output/error-codes/research/101002-knowledge.md lines 11-18 -->

## Prevention

- **Always check lock status** before calling `acquire()`
- **Implement state tracking** to know when you have pending or active locks
- **Use lock events** to coordinate multiple lock requests
- **Release locks promptly** when no longer needed to avoid conflicts
- **Avoid duplicate calls** to `acquire()` in event handlers or loops
- **Implement debouncing** for user-triggered lock requests
- **Use React hooks properly** to manage lock state in components
