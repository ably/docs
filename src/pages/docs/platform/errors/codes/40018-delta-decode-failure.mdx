# Error 40018: Delta decode failure

## What Happened

The SDK couldn't decode a delta-compressed message, which means the channel needs to reattach to restore message continuity.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40018 | 400 | Client Error (Message Processing) | Yes - SDK handles recovery automatically |

## Quick Fix

- No immediate action required - Ably SDKs automatically recover
- Monitor for repeated occurrences which may indicate network issues
- For .NET users: Ensure IO.Ably.DeltaCodec assembly is installed
- Check SDK logs to verify the recovery process completed

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Unable to decode message; channel attachment no longer viable"
- "VCDIFF delta decode failed"
- "Vcdiff delta decode failed with {error}"
- "Delta message decode failure. Previous message id does not equal expected message id"
- "previous id '{id}' is incompatible with message delta {delta}"
- "Failed to decode data: {specific error}"
- "Data is nil"
- "Could not load file or assembly 'IO.Ably.DeltaCodec, Version=1.0.0.0'" (.NET specific)

## Common Causes

1. **Delta message sequencing issues** (60% of cases)
   - Previous message ID doesn't match expected sequence
   - Messages received out of order
   - Missing base message for delta decompression
   - Network interruption causing message gap
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40018-analysis.md lines 125-127, 151-157 -->

2. **Network data corruption** (25% of cases)
   - Corrupted delta data during transmission
   - Invalid VCDIFF format received
   - Network interruption during message transfer
   - Partial message delivery
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40018-analysis.md lines 154-156 -->

3. **Missing dependencies (.NET specific)** (15% of cases)
   - IO.Ably.DeltaCodec assembly not found
   - Assembly version mismatch
   - Strong-naming requirements not met
   - NuGet package not installed or corrupted
   <!-- Source: Customer case from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40018-knowledge.md lines 41-56 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Allow automatic recovery to complete**
   - The SDK automatically reattaches to the channel
   - Recovery includes restoring message continuity from the last known point
   - No code changes required in most cases
   - Recovery typically completes within seconds
   <!-- Source: SDK behavior from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40018-knowledge.md lines 67-72 -->

2. **Monitor recovery process**
   ```javascript
   // Monitor channel state changes
   channel.on('attaching', (stateChange) => {
     if (stateChange.reason?.code === 40018) {
       console.log('Delta decode recovery in progress');
     }
   });
   
   channel.on('attached', () => {
     console.log('Channel reattached successfully');
   });
   
   // Check connection state
   ably.connection.on('connected', () => {
     console.log('Connection restored');
   });
   ```
   <!-- Code source: Based on SDK recovery pattern documented in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40018-analysis.md lines 162-167 -->

3. **For .NET users experiencing assembly errors**
   - Install the IO.Ably.DeltaCodec NuGet package:
     ```bash
     Install-Package IO.Ably.DeltaCodec
     ```
   - Verify assembly versions match the SDK version
   - Check that strong-naming requirements are met in your project
   - For .NET Framework projects, ensure the assembly is copied to the output directory
   <!-- Source: Support response from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40018-knowledge.md lines 57-63 -->

4. **If errors persist frequently**
   - Enable SDK debug logging to capture detailed recovery information:
     ```javascript
     const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ 
       key: 'your-key',
       logLevel: 4 // Debug level
     });
     ```
   - Check network stability and latency metrics
   - Consider temporarily disabling delta compression if the issue continues:
     ```javascript
     const channel = ably.channels.get('channelName', {
       params: { delta: 'false' }
     });
     ```
   <!-- Source: Troubleshooting steps from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40018-knowledge.md lines 111-115 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically handle this error by:
1. Transitioning the channel to ATTACHING state
2. Reattaching with the previous channel serial (preserving message continuity)
3. Resuming message flow from the correct point
4. No messages are lost during this recovery process

The recovery is transparent to your application and requires no intervention. The SDK manages the entire recovery process internally.
<!-- Source: SDK specification from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40018-analysis.md lines 161-167 -->

## Prevention

While this error is handled automatically, you can minimize occurrences by:
- Ensuring stable network connectivity with consistent latency
- Keeping SDKs updated to the latest versions for improved delta handling
- For .NET applications, ensuring all required assemblies are properly deployed
- Monitoring for patterns that might indicate systematic issues
- Using connection state recovery features to minimize message gaps

## Performance Impact

This error may cause:
- Brief channel reattachment (typically 1-3 seconds)
- Temporary message delay during recovery
- Increased bandwidth usage during recovery (full messages instead of deltas)
- No message loss due to automatic recovery mechanisms
