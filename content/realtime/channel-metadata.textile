h2(#overview). Overview

The @Channel Metadata API@ allows for information about channels, such as the current state changes of a channel, or the changes in its occupancy, to be accessed. This is enabled through three primary mechanisms:

* "Channel lifecycle events":#lifecycle-events are triggered when a channel changes its "lifecycle state":#lifecycle-events.
* "Channel Occupancy events":#occupancy are sent periodically whenever there is a change in the occupancy of a channel, indicating how many of each type of occupant i.e. publishers, subscribers, presence members or connections there are.
* The "Channel Status API":/rest/channel-status allows for users to query a one-off request with regards to status and occupancy data of channels using a REST query. In addition to that, it also allows you "enumerate":/rest/channel-status#enumeration-rest all the active channels in a particular app. The details of the Channel Status API are covered in out "REST library documentation":/rest/channel-status.

In addition, note that since the metadata of various channels is prone to change very frequently, unless you have a special use case within your app, we recommend you to subscribe to the realtime events via the "Channel Metadata API":/realtime/channel-metadata rather than poll for updates via REST, as this is inefficient and data is still likely to become stale as soon as you have received it.

h2(#metachannels). Metachannels

Metachannels are a namespace of channels which all start with the @[meta]@ qualifier, uniquely identifying them from regular channels. An example of a metachannel would be @[meta]channel.lifecycle@.

There are a number of metachannels available, which are:

- [meta]log := This metachannel is used to broadcast log messages (usually error messages) for events that occur within the application's context
- [meta]channel.lifecycle := This metachannel carries messages about channel lifecycle and metadata
- [meta]connection.lifecycle := This metachannel carries messages about the lifecycle of realtime connections

All of the metadata associated with an app or a channel is available on one of these metachannels only.

h2(#permissions). Permissions

A regular Ably key has a "capability":/core-features/authentication#capabilities-explained which lists available resources and, for any given resource, a set of permitted operations. The wildcard resource '@*@' will match any regular channel name.

In order to grant permission to a user to access a "metachannel":#metachannels, however, the resource name(s) in the @capability@ must include the @[meta]@ qualifier explicitly. If you are using an API Key, you can "set up capabilities in your dashboard":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000073773-is-it-possible-to-restrict-which-channels-or-permissions-an-api-key-has.

If you are making use of "tokens":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication, you specify it within the token. The following are examples of capabilities that will validly permit access to a metachannel with tokens:

minimize. See an example of a capability allowing subscription to all metachannels
  ```[json]
  {"[meta]*":["subscribe"]}
  ```

  The above will allow for the key to @subscribe@ to any @meta@ channel. The wildcard @*@ indicates anything can follow the @[meta]@ claim, so an example of a valid channel would be @[meta]log@. However, this capability will not allow for any other actions to be performed on the metachannels, nor will it allow the key to do anything with any non-metachannels.

minimize. See an example of a capability allowing all permissible actions on all metachannels and all regular channels
  ```[json]
  {
    "[meta]*":["*"],
    "*":["*"]
  }
  ```

  The above permission provides two capabilities; the ability to perform any action on any metachannel (such as @[meta]log@) with @"[meta]*":["*"]@, and the ability to perform any action on any channel (such as @another:channel@) with @"*":["*"]@. However, you are *never* able to publish or be present in a metachannel, thus this permission in effect would result in an actual permission excluding publish and presence capabilities in @[meta]@ channels due to the "intersecting capabilities":/core-features/authentication#capabilities-explained-intersection.

If @[meta]@ is not specified in the permissions, you will be unable to access the metachannels however. An example of this would be the following:

minimize. See an example of a capability which is unable to use metachannels
  ```[json]
  {
    "*":["*"]
  }
  ```

  Although the above provide all capabilities in all regular channel, without a @[meta]@ permission being explicitly specified, you will be unable to perform any actions on a @[meta]@ channel.

h2(#subscribing-to-metadata-events). Subscribing to realtime events via the Channel Metadata API

Both the "channel lifecycle":#lifecycle-events and the "occupancy":#occupancy events are published onto a special channel referred to as a "metachannel":#metachannels bearing the name @[meta]channel.lifecycle@, that can be subscribed to with our "realtime libraries":/realtime. This is often used in conjunction with the "Ably Reactor":/reactor, which allows you to send this data to your "serverless endpoints":/general/functions, "queues":/general/queues, and "streams":/general/firehose.

h3(#lifecycle-events). Lifecycle Events

The following events arise as messages on the @[meta]channel.lifecycle@ channel. In all cases, the @data@ member of the message is a "ChannelDetails":#channel-details instance.

- channel.opened := indicates that the channel has been activated globally; that is, it has become active in at least one region, having previously been inactive. The included ChannelDetails.status includes "occupancy":#occupancy globally
- channel.closed := indicates that the channel has been deactivated globally
- channel.region.active := indicates that the channel has been activated in a specific region. The included @ChannelDetails.status@ includes "occupancy":#occupancy in that region
- channel.region.inactive := indicates that the channel has been deactivated in a specific region. The included @ChannelDetails.status@ includes "occupancy":#occupancy in that region
- channel.occupancy := indicates a change in global "occupancy":#occupancy. Not all "occupancy":#occupancy changes are sent; there is a minimum interval on a per-channel basis, so if the "occupancy":#occupancy is changing continuously, then only periodic snapshots of occupancy are sent. Further roll-up of events may occur depending on the capacity of the lifecycle channel. Any "occupancy":#occupancy changes in which any of the "occupancy":#occupancy categories changes from 0 to a non-zero count, or vice versa, are always included

It is worth noting that @channel.occupancy@ events are currently only available to our "enterprise":https://www.ably.io/pricing/enterprise customers. However, you can still access "occupancy":#occupancy data within channel lifecycle events on a free account.

h3(#occupancy-events). Occupancy Events

You can subscribe to channel "occupancy":#occupancy events by attaching to the channel @[meta]channel.lifecycle@ using a realtime connection. However, realtime connections and channels have rate limits, typically "15 per second for free accounts":#https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000053845-do-you-have-any-connection-message-rate-or-other-limits-on-accounts. If the rate of channel lifecycle events exceeds this, a realtime connection is not going to be a reliable way to consume these events as you may get disconnected or lifecycle events may be discarded.

If you wish to stream this data beyond the rate limit, you can make use of "Ably Reactor":/reactor with a "Reactor Rule":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000074406-how-to-set-up-a-reactor-rule. This allows you to send data to your "serverless endpoints":/general/functions, "queues":/general/queues, or "streams":/general/firehose for processing.

h3(#reactor). Reactor rules

You can associate "Reactor rules":https://www.ably.io/reactor with metachannels in the same way as for regular channels; configure these using the "Message":/realtime/messages source and use a @channelFilter@ that matches the metachannel's name. Please note: the *Channel Lifecycle* events are *not* supported with Reactor Webhooks.

h2(#use-cases). Use cases

Having access to channel metadata can provide numerous benefits. In a scenario where the number of subscribers of a channel goes well beyond a hundred, usage of other options such as "presence":/core-features/presence becomes less effective leading to an unexpected n-squared problem if all of the clients are subscribed to presence. You could instead make use of our "channel metadata":#metachannels to check the number of active subscribers.

Equally, you may want to publish your data only if there is a subscriber for that data. The "channel lifecycle events":#lifecycle-events can notify you when a channel is opened, becomes active, or is no longer active thus giving your publisher clients an opportunity to know when the last subscriber leaves the channel.

If you need to be able to query channel metadata at any point, you can make use of the "Channel Status API":/rest/channel-status#metadata-rest to inspect the state of individual channels, or "enumerate":/rest/channel-status#enumeration-rest all active channels in an app.

h1. Channel Metadata API Reference

inline-toc.
  Types:
    - ChannelDetails#channel-details
    - ChannelStatus#channel-status
    - Occupancy#occupancy

h2(#types). Types

The payload of metadata events for channels is the "ChannelDetails":#channel-details type which contains the @channelId@ and other static information about the channel, plus a @status@ containing a "ChannelStatus":#channel-status instance which contains information about the current state of the channel.

h3(#channel-details). ChannelDetails

ChannelDetails is an object returned when requesting channel metadata. It contains information on the channel itself, along with the current state of the channel in the "ChannelStatus":#channel-status object.

- channelId := the required name of the channel including any qualifier, if any<br>__Type: @string@__
- region := in events relating to the activity of a channel in a specific region, this optionally identifies the region<br>__Type: @string@__
- isGlobalMaster := in events relating to the activity of a channel in a specific region, this optionally identifies whether or not that region is responsible for global coordination of the channel<br>__Type: @string@__
- status := an optional "ChannelStatus":#channel-status instance<br>__Type: "ChannelStatus":/#channel-status__

h3(#channel-status). ChannelDetails.ChannelStatus

ChannelStatus is contained within the above ChannelDetails object, and optionally contains the below "Occupancy":#occupancy object.

- isActive := a required boolean value indicating whether the channel that is the subject of the event is active. For events indicating regional activity of a channel this indicates activity in that region, not global activity<br>__Type: @boolean@__
- occupancy := an optional "Occupancy":#occupancy instance indicating the occupancy of the channel. For events indicating regional activity of a channel this indicates activity in that region, not global activity.<br>__Type: "Occupancy":#occupancy__

h3(#occupancy). ChannelDetails.ChannelStatus.Occupancy

Occupancy is optionally contained within the above "ChannelStatus":#channel-status object, and contains information on the occupants of the channel. This is usually contained within the *metrics* object, an optional dictionary of membership categories for a realtime channel and their counts. Membership categories include:

- publishers := the number of connections attached to the channel that are authorised to publish<br>__Type: @integer@__
- subscribers := the number of connections attached that are authorised to subscribe to messages<br>__Type: @integer@__
- presenceSubscribers := the number of connections that are authorised to subscribe to presence messages<br>__Type: @integer@__
- presenceConnections := the number of connections that are authorised to enter members into the presence channel<br>__Type: @integer@__
- presenceMembers := the number of members currently entered into the presence channel<br>__Type: @integer@__
