# Error 10000: No error (operational state)

## What Happened?

You received a status code that indicates a successful operation or an intentional state transition, despite being labeled as an "error" code.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 10000 | 200 | Operational State | Context-dependent - see common causes |

## Quick Fix

- If you see "Can't attach when not in an active state": Wait for the connection to become active before attaching channels
- If your app just returned from background: Re-establish the connection first
- For message filtering scenarios: This is intentional behavior, no action needed

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Connection closed by client"
- "Can't attach when not in an active state"
- "Discarding message; not local origin"
- "Message discarded by perMessageTransform"

## Common Causes

1. **Channel operations on inactive connections** (40% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/10000-analysis.md lines 29-31 -->
   - Attempting to attach channels when connection isn't active
   - App returning from background state on mobile devices
   - Connection not yet established or already closed

2. **Client-initiated connection closure** (30% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/10000-analysis.md lines 18-21 -->
   - Normal connection termination by your application
   - Explicit disconnect() calls
   - App shutdown or cleanup

3. **Message filtering by server rules** (30% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/10000-analysis.md lines 36-55 -->
   - Messages from non-local origins when local-only rules apply
   - Messages discarded by transformation functions
   - Intentional server-side filtering

## Resolution Steps

### For "Can't attach when not in an active state"

1. **Check connection state before operations**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/10000-knowledge.md lines 76-79 -->
   ```javascript
   // Wait for connection to be ready
   ably.connection.on('connected', () => {
     // Now safe to attach channels
     const channel = ably.channels.get('my-channel');
     channel.attach();
   });
   ```

2. **Handle mobile app lifecycle events**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/10000-knowledge.md lines 136-139, 167-171 -->
   ```javascript
   // Re-establish connection when app returns from background
   document.addEventListener('resume', () => {
     ably.connection.connect();
   });
   ```

3. **Monitor connection state changes**
   <!-- Source: Based on Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection#connection-state-recovery -->
   ```javascript
   ably.connection.on('disconnected', () => {
     console.log('Connection lost, will auto-reconnect');
   });
   
   ably.connection.on('connected', () => {
     console.log('Connection restored');
   });
   ```

### For "Connection closed by client"

This indicates normal operation - your application explicitly closed the connection. No recovery needed unless you want to reconnect:
<!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/10000-analysis.md lines 18-21 -->

```javascript
// To reconnect after closing
ably.connection.connect();
```

### For Message Filtering

Messages with "not local origin" or "discarded by perMessageTransform" are intentionally filtered based on your integration rules. This is expected behavior and requires no action unless you need to adjust your filtering rules.
<!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/10000-analysis.md lines 69-73 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs handle connection state transitions automatically:
<!-- Source: Based on Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection#connection-state-recovery -->
- Automatic reconnection when connections drop
- State recovery within 2 minutes of disconnection
- Channel reattachment after reconnection

For error 10000 specifically, the SDK doesn't retry automatically since it represents successful operations or intentional states.

## Prevention

### For Mobile Applications
<!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/10000-knowledge.md lines 167-171 -->
- Implement proper app lifecycle handling
- Re-establish connections after backgrounding
- Don't attempt operations immediately after foreground transition

### For Channel Operations
<!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/10000-knowledge.md lines 164-166 -->
- Always check connection state before channel operations
- Use connection state listeners to coordinate operations
- Handle connection state transitions gracefully
