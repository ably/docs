# Error 80010: Invalid transport handle

## What Happened

The connection operation cannot proceed because the underlying transport handle is in an invalid or unexpected state.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 80010 | 400 | Connection (Client) | No - requires state validation |

## Quick Fix

- Check your connection state before attempting operations
- Wait for the connection to reach `connected` state
- Implement proper connection state event listeners

## Error Messages

You may see this message in iOS/macOS applications:
- "Invalid operation (connection state is [state number] - [state name])"

The message includes the actual connection state for debugging purposes.

## Common Causes

1. **Attempting operations during state transitions** (most common)
   - Trying to publish or subscribe while connection is changing states
   - Race conditions between multiple connection operations
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80010-analysis.md lines 16-22 -->

2. **Invalid connection state**
   - Connection is in an unexpected or undefined state
   - Transport handle has been superseded or invalidated
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80010-knowledge.md lines 11-13 -->

3. **SDK lifecycle issues**
   - Improper connection initialization sequence
   - Missing state validation before operations
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80010-knowledge.md lines 14-17 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Validate connection state before operations**
   ```swift
   // iOS/macOS - Check connection state first
   if realtime.connection.state == .connected {
       // Safe to perform operations
       channel.publish("event", data: message)
   } else {
       // Wait for connection
       realtime.connection.on(.connected) {
           channel.publish("event", data: message)
       }
   }
   ```
   <!-- Source: Based on SDK patterns from analysis and connection state management best practices -->

2. **Implement proper state listeners**
   ```swift
   // Monitor connection state changes
   realtime.connection.on { stateChange in
       switch stateChange.current {
       case .connected:
           // Connection ready for operations
           performPendingOperations()
       case .connecting, .disconnected:
           // Queue operations or show waiting state
           queueOperations()
       case .suspended, .failed, .closed:
           // Handle error states
           handleConnectionError(stateChange.reason)
       default:
           break
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Handle timing and race conditions**
   - Avoid rapid successive connection operations
   - Use connection promises or callbacks instead of assuming immediate state
   - Implement proper error handling for state conflicts
   <!-- Source: Troubleshooting guidance from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80010-knowledge.md lines 37-41 -->

4. **Review your connection management**
   - Ensure proper SDK initialization
   - Verify connection lifecycle handling
   - Check for concurrent operations that might conflict
   <!-- Source: Knowledge base recommendations from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80010-knowledge.md lines 43-46 -->

## Automatic Handling

The Ably SDK does not automatically retry this error as it indicates a client-side state validation issue that requires your application to check the connection state and retry when appropriate.

## Prevention

- **Always validate connection state** before performing operations
- **Use event-driven patterns** - listen for connection state changes rather than assuming state
- **Implement proper error handling** for all connection operations
- **Design for connection lifecycle** - structure your app flow around connection states

## Platform Information

This error code is specific to the **iOS/macOS (Cocoa) SDK**. Other SDKs may handle similar scenarios with different error codes or mechanisms.
