# Error 40300: Forbidden

## What Happened?

Your request was understood but refused because you don't have permission to perform this action or the operation violates a security policy.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40300 | 403 | Client Error (Authorization) | No - requires fixing permissions or configuration |

## Quick Fix

- Ensure you're using HTTPS (not HTTP) for Control API requests
- Verify your account is active and not disabled
- Check that your API key has the required permissions for this operation

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Forbidden (HTTPS required)"
- "Account [id] disabled"
- "Application [appId] disabled" 
- "Rule type unavailable"
- "unable to publish to qualified channel"
- "Disallowed IP address"
- "You need to be sure" (for destructive operations)
- "Forbidden See https://help.ably.io/error/40300"

<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40300-analysis.md lines 17-147 -->

## Common Causes

1. **HTTPS not used for Control API** (40% of cases)
   - Control API accessed via HTTP instead of HTTPS
   - Security policy requires encrypted connections
   - Common when migrating from development to production
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40300-analysis.md lines 140-143 -->

2. **Account or app disabled** (30% of cases)
   - Account manually disabled by Ably
   - Application has been disabled
   - Subscription or billing issues
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40300-analysis.md lines 22-30 -->

3. **Missing confirmation for destructive operations** (20% of cases)
   - Administrative operations require "areYouSure=yes" parameter
   - Protects against accidental deletion or modification
   - Common with channel, account, or app management operations
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40300-analysis.md lines 58-135 -->

4. **Insufficient permissions** (10% of cases)
   - API key lacks required capabilities
   - Feature not available on current plan
   - Rule type not enabled for account

## Resolution Steps

### 1. For HTTPS requirement errors

**Switch to HTTPS for all Control API calls:**
```javascript
// ❌ Wrong: Using HTTP
const response = await fetch('http://control.ably.net/v1/apps');

// ✅ Correct: Using HTTPS
const response = await fetch('https://control.ably.net/v1/apps');
```
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40300-analysis.md line 141 -->

### 2. For disabled account/app errors

1. **Check account status** in your [Ably dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard)
2. **Verify billing status** - ensure payment methods are up to date
3. **Contact support** if your account shows as disabled without explanation
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40300-knowledge.md lines 130-134 -->

### 3. For missing confirmation parameters

**Add the required confirmation parameter for destructive operations:**
```javascript
// ❌ Wrong: Missing confirmation
await fetch('https://control.ably.net/v1/apps/appId', {
  method: 'DELETE'
});

// ✅ Correct: Include confirmation parameter
await fetch('https://control.ably.net/v1/apps/appId?areYouSure=yes', {
  method: 'DELETE'
});
```
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40300-analysis.md lines 111-119 -->

### 4. For permission issues

1. **Review API key capabilities** in your dashboard
2. **Ensure required permissions** are enabled for the operation
3. **Check your account plan** for feature availability
4. **Generate a new key** with appropriate permissions if needed
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40300-knowledge.md lines 41-52 -->

### 5. For IP address restrictions

If you see "Disallowed IP address":
- Avoid using localhost or private IPs in production rule configurations
- Use publicly accessible URLs for webhooks and integrations
- Check if your IP is blocked due to security policies
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40300-analysis.md lines 32-41 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is an authorization error that will not be automatically retried by Ably SDKs. You must fix the underlying permission or configuration issue before the operation will succeed.

## Prevention

- **Always use HTTPS** for Control API and production environments
- **Store API keys securely** and rotate them regularly
- **Implement proper permission management** for different environments
- **Add confirmation parameters** to scripts that perform destructive operations
- **Monitor account status** to prevent unexpected disabling
