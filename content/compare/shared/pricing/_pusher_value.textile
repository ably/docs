Pusher prices its three products - Channels, Pusher Beams (aka push notifications), and Pusher ChatKit - separately and in tiers. If you’re looking for modular implementation this can be helpful. However, it can be frustrating to try and get a single overview if you wanted to adopt two or more - which many developers will want to do. And tier-based pricing isn’t the most flexible.

The main issue with Pusher’s pricing is tiering. The nature of realtime messaging and streaming data means connections, required channels, and messages often fluctuate. Plus it’s never easy to estimate how much you’ll need upfront anyway - especially true for realtime uses such as HQ-style games or live event/sports apps.

With this pricing model if you exceed any one attribute of a tier you’ll likely be forced into another more expensive tier. For example, moving from Pro to Business hikes the price from $99 to $299 per month. A better way is usage-based pricing where you only ever pay for capacity you’ve actually used.

Then there’s Beams.

Again, Beams is based on tiers rather than usage. There’s quite a difference between 10,000 devices for $99/month and up to 50,000 devices for $399/month. If you need 11,000 devices it looks like you’d need to fork over another $300 for only 1,000 more devices, which doesn’t make much sense. It’s possible there’s room for flexibility if you get in touch with Pusher.

Finally there’s ChatKit.

Once again, the major problem lies in concrete tiering with little room for manoeuvre. Depending on where your customers reside data protection could be an issue with only 90-day retention the standard for business tiers.

Overall Pusher’s rigid pricing tiers don’t seem to encourage growth or provide a joined-up view of data streaming costs. That said, Pusher’s pricing is simple and easily understood.

To sum up, Fanout is a cheaper alternative to Pusher. However, the pricing schemes of both providers require users to look carefully at what their streaming needs are now, and in future, to make sure invoices remain free of unpleasant surprises.
