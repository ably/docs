# Error 10200: Unrecognized error code

## What Happened

An unrecognized error code was encountered. This error code is not currently active in Ably's systems.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 10200 | N/A | Unknown | No - unrecognized error |

## Quick Fix

- Verify you're using the latest SDK version
- Check if you meant to reference error code 102000 (Chat room validation)
- Contact Ably support for assistance

## Error Messages

This error code has no associated error messages in Ably's current systems.

## Common Causes

This error code may appear due to:

1. **Parsing or logging issues**
   - Error extraction tools misrepresenting other error codes
   - Logging systems truncating longer error codes
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/10200-analysis.md lines 64-67 -->

2. **Possible confusion with error 102000**
   - Chat room name validation errors
   - If working with Ably Chat, check room name format
   <!-- Source: Knowledge finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/10200-knowledge.md lines 59-69 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify the actual error code**
   - Check your logs for the complete error code
   - Look for 6-digit error codes that may have been truncated
   <!-- Source: Based on CSV parsing bug discovery in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/10200-analysis.md lines 64-67 -->

2. **If using Ably Chat**
   - You may be encountering error 102000 (room name validation)
   - Ensure room names don't start with ':', ',', '[' or spaces
   - Ensure room names don't contain '::$'
   <!-- Source: Room validation from actual error 102000 in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/10200-analysis.md lines 20-33 -->

3. **Update your SDK**
   - Ensure you're using the latest version of your Ably SDK
   - Check available SDKs and versions in the Ably documentation

## Automatic Handling

This error code is not recognized by Ably SDKs and will not be automatically handled.

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Error extraction tools need documentation about handling 6-digit error codes
- Impact: CSV parsing bugs create confusion about which error codes exist
- Recommendation: Fix CSV extraction tool to properly handle error codes like 102000
- Severity: Low (only affects internal tooling, not customer-facing systems)
-->

<!-- IMPROVEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
To improve this error code documentation:
1. First approach: Fix the CSV extraction bug that misrepresents 102000 as 10200
2. Regenerate: Run `./bin/ably-os errors document-error-codes 10200 --force`
3. For broader improvements: Update CSV extraction scripts to validate parsed error codes
4. Context: See https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/docs/ERROR_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md
