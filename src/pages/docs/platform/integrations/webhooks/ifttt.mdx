[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) (If This Then That) integrations enable you to trigger conditional chains, and help to combine various services together when an event occurs in Ably.

## Create a IFTTT integration <a id="create"/>

To create an IFTTT integration in your [dashboard:](https://ably.com/dashboard/any)

1. Login and select the application you wish to integrate with IFTTT.
2. Click the **Integrations** tab.
3. Click the **New Integration Rule** button.
4. Choose **Webhook**.
5. Choose **IFTTT**.
6. Configure the IFTTT [settings](#settings).
7. Click **Create**.

You can also create an IFTTT integration using the [Control API](/docs/platform/account/control-api).

### Settings <a id="settings"/>

The following settings are available when creating an IFTTT integration:

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| IFTTT Webhook key | The webhook key for your IFTTT account. |
| Event name | The name used to identify the IFTTT applet. |
| [Source](/docs/integrations/webhooks#sources) | Specifies the event types being sent to IFTTT. |
| [Channel filter](/docs/integrations/webhooks#filter) | Filters the source channels based on a regular expression. |
| Encoding | Specifies the encoding format of messages. Either JSON or MsgPack. |

## Restrictions <a id="restrictions"/>

IFTTT has limitations on the data it can process. All payloads must be `JSON` and use only the keys `value1`, `value2`, or `value3`. Any other format or additional keys will not be processed.

As a result, [enveloping](/docs/integrations/webhooks#enveloped), "batching":/docs/integrations/webhooks#batching are not supported. Additionally, protocols that require decoding such as [MQTT](/docs/protocols/mqtt), are not supported with IFTTT.

To ensure data is processed by IFTTT, it must match the required IFTTT structure. The following example shows the headers and payload sent to IFTTT when a message is sent to a channel:

<Code>
```json
{
  "value1" :"data I want to send 1",
  "value2" :"data I want to send 2",
  "value3" :"data I want to send 3"
}
```
</Code>

For a [message data](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/messages#data) or [presence message data](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/presence#presence-message) of `{ "value1": "My first message", "value2": "My second message" }`, the following would be sent to your IFTTT endpoint:

Headers:

<Code>
```text
host: https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/{YOUR_EVENT}/with/key/{YOUR_IFTTT_KEY}
content-type: application/json
x-ably-envelope-appid: {YOUR_APP_ID}
x-ably-envelope-channel: {YOUR_CHANNEL}
x-ably-envelope-rule-id: {YOUR_RULE_ID}
x-ably-envelope-site: {ably-server-location}
x-ably-envelope-source: channel.message
x-ably-message-encoding: json
x-ably-message-id: {UNIQUE_ABLY_MESSAGE_ID}
x-ably-message-timestamp: {TIMESTAMP_ORIGINAL_MESSAGE_WAS_SENT}
x-ably-version: 1.2
content-length: 18
connection: keep-alive
```
</Code>

Payload:

<Code>
```json
{
  "value1": "My first message",
  "value2": "My second message"
}
```
</Code>
