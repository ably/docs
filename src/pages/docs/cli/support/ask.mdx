## Examples

Ask a basic question:

<Code>
```shell
ably support ask "How do I get started with Ably?"
```
</Code>

Ask about specific features:

<Code>
```shell
ably support ask "What are the available capabilities for tokens?"
```
</Code>

Ask a technical question:

<Code>
```shell
ably support ask "How do I publish to a channel?"
```
</Code>

**Output:**
<Code>
```text
To publish to a channel in Ably, first create a channel instance and then use the publish method. Here's how to do it:

  const realtime = new Ably.Realtime('xVLyHw.DovQSg:*');
  const channel = realtime.channels.get('cod-paw-mic');
  await channel.publish('example', 'message data');

You can publish a single message or multiple messages at once. When publishing multiple messages, they are published atomically, meaning either all messages will be published successfully or none of them will be.
