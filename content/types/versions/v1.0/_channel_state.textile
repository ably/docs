  h4. Symbol states

  ```[ruby]
    :initialized # => 0
    :attaching # =>   1
    :attached # =>    2
    :detaching # =>   3
    :detached # =>    4
    :failed # =>      5
  ```

  h4. Constant states

  ```[ruby]
    Channel::STATE.Initialized # => 0
    Channel::STATE.Attaching # =>   1
    Channel::STATE.Attached # =>    2
    Channel::STATE.Detaching # =>   3
    Channel::STATE.Detached # =>    4
    Channel::STATE.Failed # =>      5

  h4. Example usage

  ```[ruby]
    # Example with symbols
    channel.on(:attached) { ... }

    # Example with constants
    channel.on(Ably::Realtime::Channel::STATE.Attached) { ... }

    # Interchangeable
    Ably::Realtime::Channel::STATE.Attached == :attached # => true
