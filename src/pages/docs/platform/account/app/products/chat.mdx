The Chat section in your Ably dashboard provides a centralized hub for managing realtime messaging and user interactions across your chat application. Access the [Chat dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/chat) to monitor and manage your chat rooms. From this overview page, you can quickly access getting started guides for different platforms, explore ready-to-use examples, and review recent product updates through the changelog.

The dashboard makes it easy to jump into room monitoring, review implementation patterns, and stay updated with the latest Chat features and fixes.

## Rooms <a id="rooms"/>

The rooms interface serves as your primary dashboard for monitoring and managing all chat messaging activity across your application. This section provides realtime visibility into room performance, user connections, and message flow, enabling you to quickly identify issues and optimize your chat implementation.

Navigate to the rooms section through the dashboard sidebar under Products > Chat > Rooms. The main rooms view displays all active rooms in a clean, searchable interface that makes it easy to monitor your entire chat infrastructure at a glance.

### Room browser functionality <a id="room-browser"/>

The room finder search box allows you to quickly locate specific rooms by name - essential when managing applications with numerous rooms across different features or namespaces. Simply enter a room name or partial match to filter the results and find the rooms you need to inspect.

The interface shows exactly how many rooms are currently active with a counter display, giving you immediate awareness of your application's chat scope and helping you track room growth over time.

Each room entry shows the **room name** for identification, the **user count** displaying realtime connected users for monitoring activity patterns, and an **inspect button** (eye icon) for accessing detailed monitoring and configuration.

The user count column is particularly valuable for identifying rooms experiencing high activity, unusual participation patterns, or potential connection issues. Rooms with unexpectedly high or low user counts can indicate performance problems, client-side issues, or changes in user behavior that need investigation.

## Room inspection <a id="inspection"/>

When you click the inspect button (eye icon) next to any room in the rooms list, you access a comprehensive room monitoring interface that provides deep visibility into that specific room's behavior, performance, and configuration.



### Room inspection overview <a id="inspection-overview"/>

The inspection page opens with a detailed overview showing critical room information and realtime metrics. The header displays the full room name with a copy button for easy reference, along with breadcrumb navigation back to the main rooms list.

#### Live analytics and visualization

The inspection interface provides two primary analytics sections with live, updating charts that help you understand room behavior over time.

##### Messages analytics

The messages chart displays realtime inbound and outbound message flow with color-coded tracking for different message types. Use this to identify message patterns and delivery bottlenecks.

##### Occupancy analytics

The occupancy chart tracks connections, participants, and presence members over time. Use this data to understand user engagement patterns and optimize your chat architecture.

#### Room configuration and rules

The rules section provides comprehensive configuration options for controlling room behavior and security requirements. You can configure three categories of rules:

| Rule category | Configuration options |
|---|---|
| Storage rules | Persist last message, persist all messages. |
| Room rules | Identification required, TLS required. |
| Feature rules | Push notifications, message annotations/updates/deletes. |

#### Integrations

The integrations section allows you to connect rooms to external services and configure automated workflows triggered by room activity.

Use the **Add integration** button to set up new external connections.

#### Live logs and debugging

The live logs section provides essential debugging capabilities through realtime event monitoring and error tracking.

| Log type | Description |
|---|---|
| API requests | Monitor REST API calls and authentication attempts. |
| Rooms | Track room creation, configuration changes, and lifecycle events. |
| Connections | Monitor user connections, disconnections, and connection state changes. |
| Integration errors | Identify webhook failures, external service timeouts, and integration issues. |

When the logs show no entries, this indicates normal room operation without errors or notable events. During active debugging or high-traffic periods, you'll see realtime event streams that help diagnose issues and verify system behavior.

## Connections <a id="connections"/>

The connections tab provides detailed visibility into all users currently connected to your room, enabling you to monitor individual user behavior and troubleshoot client-specific issues.

### Connection overview <a id="connection-overview"/>

When you select the connections tab from the room inspection interface, you'll see a comprehensive list of all active connections to that specific room. The interface displays key connection information in an organized table format.

The following outlines the connection information displayed:

| Column | Information displayed |
|---|---|
| Connection ID | Unique identifier for each user connection. |
| Client ID | Application-defined user identifier. |
| Country | Geographic location of the connection. |
| SDK | Client SDK version and platform. |

The connection list shows practical information including the total number of active connections. Each connection entry includes an inspect button (eye icon) for detailed connection analysis.

### Individual connection inspection <a id="individual-connection"/>

When you click the inspect button on any connection, you access a detailed connection monitoring interface that provides comprehensive information about that specific user's behavior and configuration.

#### Overview

The overview tab displays essential information about the user connection:

| Connection detail | Information displayed |
