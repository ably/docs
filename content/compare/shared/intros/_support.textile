Even if a platform or product is well-designed and the docs are strong, the nature of software and complex infrastructure means you’ll inevitably need to talk to a human at some point. Whether it’s about pricing, implementation, or a bug - support is a fact of building stuff on the internet. So it’s essential you can rely on responsive, helpful support.

Good indicators are short response times across live chat and email, access to people who understand the nitty gritty technical details of the platform, and an up-to-date support portal for docs. An active community with forums or a group chat can also be a good sign.
