<Code>
```shell
ably rooms typing keystroke <room> [flags]
```
</Code>

Use the `ably rooms typing keystroke` command to emit a typing event update in an Ably Chat room.

Use another terminal instance and the [`ably rooms typing subscribe`](/docs/cli/rooms/typing/subscribe) command to view typing events as they are sent.

## Arguments

### `<room>` <a id="room"/>

The room to start typing in, for example: `example-room`.

## Flags

You can optionally pass the following flags to the `ably rooms typing keystroke` command:

### `--autoType` <a id="autoType"/>

Automatically keep a typing indicator active by repeatedly sending typing events until the command is terminated. Without this flag, only a single typing event is sent.

## Global flags

The following global flags are supported using the `ably rooms typing keystroke` command:

* [`--token`](/docs/cli#token)
* [`--json`](/docs/cli#json)
* [`--pretty-json`](/docs/cli#pretty-json)
* [`--api-key`](/docs/cli#api-key)
* [`--access-token`](/docs/cli#access-token)
* [`--client-id`](/docs/cli#client-id)
* [`--env`](/docs/cli#env)
* [`--host`](/docs/cli#host)
* [`--endpoint`](/docs/cli#endpoint)
* [`--verbose`](/docs/cli#verbose)

## Examples

### Send a single typing indicator event

Send a single typing keystroke event:

<Code>
```shell

```
</Code>

### Send continuous typing indicator events

Send continuous typing events until terminated:

<Code>
```shell
ably rooms typing keystroke example-room --autoType
```
</Code>

**Output:**
<Code>
```text
Using: App=example-app (Ab1CdE) • Key=example-key (Ab1CdE.FgHiJk)
