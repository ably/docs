Now that our app is ready, let's test it out. Before using any of these methods make sure you have built and run the app, and have successfully activated it for Push Notifications. We'll be using curl commands to publish messages for simplicity, however our libraries have all the "functionality for publishing":/general/push/publish used here as well.

h3. a. Testing using Device ID

Using the Device ID logged when activating the device, run the following curl:

```[sh]
curl -X POST https://rest.ably.io/push/publish \
 -u "YOUR_API_KEY" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data \
 '
{
  "recipient": {
    "deviceId": "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
  },
  "notification": {
    "title": "Hello from Ably via Device ID!",
    "body": "Example push notification from Ably."
  }
}'
```

Make sure to replace @YOUR_API_KEY@ with your API Key, and @YOUR_DEVICE_ID@ with your Device ID.

If you had the app open, you should see a new line in the log letting you know a message was received. If you had closed the app, you should see a Push Notification like below:

</a>

h3. b. Testing using Client ID

Using the Client ID logged when connecting to Ably, run the following curl:

```[sh]
curl -X POST https://rest.ably.io/push/publish \
 -u "YOUR_API_KEY" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data \
 '
{
  "recipient": {
    "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
  },
  "notification": {
    "title": "Hello from Ably via Client ID!",
    "body": "Example push notification from Ably."
  }
}'
```

Make sure to replace @YOUR_API_KEY@ with your API Key, and @YOUR_CLIENT_ID@ with your Client ID.

h3. c. Testing using Channels

You can also publish messages using Ably "channels":/realtime/channels, by adding a @push@ object to a "message":/realtime/messages sent on it. Publishing via a channel is the easiest way to publish a Push Notification to a collection of devices with different client and device IDs.

```[sh]
curl -X POST https://rest.ably.io/channels/MY_PUSH_CHANNEL/messages \
 -u "YOUR_API_KEY" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data \
 '
{ "name": "myMessage",
  "extras": {
    "push": {
      "notification": {
        "title": "Hello from Ably!",
        "body": "Example push notification from Ably."
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Make sure to replace @YOUR_API_KEY@ with your API key, and @MY_PUSH_CHANNEL@ with the Ably channel your app is subscribed to, in this tutorial being @push:test_push_channel@.
