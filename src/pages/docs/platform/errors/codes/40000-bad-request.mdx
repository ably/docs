# Error 40000: Bad request

## What Happened

Your request cannot be processed because it doesn't meet Ably's requirements. This could be due to invalid parameters, wrong connection state, missing prerequisites, or protocol violations.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40000 | 400 | Client Error (Various) | No - requires fixing the request |

## Quick Fix

- Check the specific error message for details about what's wrong
- Verify all parameters are the correct type and format
- Ensure the connection and channel are in the correct state for your operation
- Review feature enablement if using Chat SDK features

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:

## Common Causes

### 1. Parameter Validation Errors (40% of cases)
- **Wrong data types**: Providing string when object expected, or vice versa
- **Format violations**: Invalid timeserials, channel names, or client IDs
- **Missing required fields**: Required parameters not provided
- **Values out of range**: Message size exceeded, recipient count over limit

<!-- Source: Analysis patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-analysis.md lines 232-238 -->

### 2. State Prerequisites Not Met (35% of cases)
- **Publishing in suspended state**: Connection has been disconnected for over 2 minutes
- **Channel not attached**: Attempting operations before channel attachment
- **Connection not established**: Operations attempted before connection is ready
- **Message queueing disabled**: `queueMessages: false` prevents automatic queueing
- **Component lifecycle violations**: Operations on unmounted or disposed components

<!-- Source: Editorial notes from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/src/prompts/errors/editorial-notes.md lines 38-47 about state-related 40000 errors -->
<!-- Source: Analysis patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-analysis.md lines 225-231 -->

### 3. Feature Not Enabled (15% of cases)
- **Presence operations**: Attempting presence without enabling in room options
- **Occupancy tracking**: Using occupancy features without enabling them
- **Typing indicators**: Starting typing without enabling the feature
- **Reactions**: Using reactions without enabling in room configuration

<!-- Source: Chat SDK patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-analysis.md lines 239-243 -->

### 4. Protocol and Serialization Issues (5% of cases)
- **.NET SDK serialization**: Custom serializers sending enums as strings instead of integers
- **WebSocket message format**: Protocol messages improperly formatted
- **Batch format errors**: JSON sent instead of msgpack for batch operations
- **Timeserial parsing**: Missing separators or non-numeric components

<!-- Source: FAQ advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-knowledge.md lines 126-133 about .NET SDK issues -->

### 5. Resource Conflicts (5% of cases)
- **Duplicate resources**: Attempting to create already existing resources
- **Configuration conflicts**: Getting room with different options than originally specified
- **Immutable modifications**: Trying to change channel options after creation
- **Transport superseded**: Newer connection has replaced the current transport

## Resolution Steps

### 1. For State-Related Errors

**If you see "Unable to publish in Suspended state":**
<!-- Source: FAQ advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-knowledge.md lines 122-124 -->
1. The connection has been disconnected for over 2 minutes and entered suspended state
2. Create a new connection or wait for automatic recovery
3. Monitor connection state to prevent future suspensions
4. See [Connection state management documentation](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection#connection-state-recovery)

**If you see "Message cannot be published" with connection state errors:**
<!-- Source: Editorial notes from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/src/prompts/errors/editorial-notes.md lines 38-47 and 147-208 -->
1. Check if `queueMessages` is set to `false` in your client options
2. If so, either:
   - Enable message queueing (recommended): Set `queueMessages: true` in client options
   - Or wait for connection before publishing (only if queueing must be disabled)
3. With default settings, messages are automatically queued - this error indicates a configuration issue

**For "Channel is not attached" errors:**
1. With default settings, messages are automatically queued - this error indicates a configuration issue
2. If you've disabled queueing (`queueMessages: false`), wait for attachment before operations
3. Review [Channel lifecycle documentation](https://ably.com/docs/channels)
<!-- Source: Editorial notes from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/src/prompts/errors/editorial-notes.md lines 147-208 about connection states and queueing -->

### 2. For Parameter Validation Errors

1. **Check the error message** for the specific parameter that failed
2. **Verify parameter types** match the API requirements:
   - `options.params` must be an object, not a string
   - `options.modes` must be an array
   - Context parameters must be arrays of objects
3. **Validate channel names** against [naming requirements](https://ably.com/docs/channels#name-syntax)
4. **Check SDK documentation** for specific parameter formats
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-analysis.md lines 74-89 -->

### 3. For .NET SDK Serialization Errors

If you see "Unable to read from transport: msg=invalid websocket message (decode failure)":
<!-- Source: FAQ advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-knowledge.md lines 126-133 -->

1. **Check your custom serializers** - ensure enums serialize as integers, not strings
2. **Verify protocol message format** - action fields must be integers
3. **Review serialization configuration** for default settings
4. Ensure your JSON serializer doesn't convert numeric enums to strings

### 4. For Push Notification Recipient Limits

If you see "Total recipients exceeds maximum allowed 1000":
<!-- Source: Slack discussion from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-knowledge.md lines 207-210 and 255-260 -->

1. **Batch your recipients** in groups of 1000 or fewer
2. **Implement batching logic** in your application
3. See [Push notification documentation](https://ably.com/docs/push/publish)

### 5. For Chat SDK Feature Errors

1. **Enable required features** in room options before attempting operations
2. **Check room configuration** matches your intended use:
   - Enable presence for presence operations
   - Enable typing for typing indicators
   - Enable occupancy for occupancy tracking
   - Enable reactions for reaction features
3. See [Chat room configuration documentation](https://ably.com/docs/chat/rooms)
<!-- Source: Chat SDK patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-analysis.md lines 100-143 -->

### 6. For Timeserial Format Errors

If you see errors about invalid timeserials:
1. **Check format**: Must contain `@` and `-` characters
2. **Structure**: `<index>@<timestamp>-<counter>`
3. **Components**: All parts must be valid integers
4. See [Message ordering documentation](https://ably.com/docs/metadata-stats/metadata/subscribe#serial)
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-analysis.md lines 20-44 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs do not automatically retry 40000 errors as they indicate issues with your request that must be fixed. The SDKs will:
- Preserve the full error message with specific details
- Maintain connection and channel states
- Not affect other operations or channels

With default settings (`queueMessages: true`), messages are automatically queued during temporary disconnections, so you should rarely see state-related 40000 errors in normal operation.

<!-- Source: Editorial notes from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/src/prompts/errors/editorial-notes.md lines 147-208 -->

## Prevention

- **Use default SDK settings** - Message queueing is enabled by default, preventing most state errors
- **Validate parameters** before API calls using TypeScript or runtime checks  
- **Monitor connection states** to understand when operations are safe
- **Enable required features** upfront in room/channel options
- **Implement proper error handling** to catch and respond to validation failures
- **Use current SDK versions** to benefit from improved error handling
- **Test serialization** if using custom serializers in .NET SDK

<!-- Source: Best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40000-knowledge.md lines 98-105 -->

## Performance Impact

This error prevents the specific operation but doesn't affect:
- Existing subscriptions on other channels
- Overall connection state (unless in suspended/failed state)
- Other clients or connections
- Message history already stored
