The following capability operations are available for API keys and issued tokens:

- subscribe := can subscribe to messages and presence state change messages on channels, and get the presence set of a channel
- publish := can publish messages to channels
- presence := can register presence on a channel (enter, update and leave)
- history := can retrieve message and presence state history on channels
- stats := can retrieve current and historical usage statistics for an app
- push-subscribe := can subscribe devices for push notifications
- push-admin := can manage device registrations and push subscriptions for all devices in an app
- channel-metadata := can get metadata for a channel, and enumerate channels
- privileged-headers := can set data in the privileged section of the "message extras":/api/rest-sdk/messages#extras

Read the "capabilities docs":/auth/capabilities to get a more thorough overview of how capabilities can be used to secure your application.

While most of these capabilities need to be enabled for the resource you're using them with, as described in "resource names and wildcards":/auth/capabilities#wildcards, there are exceptions. The @stats@ permission only does something when attached to the wildcard resource @'*'@, or a resource that contains that as a subset, such as @'[*]*'@, since stats are app-wide. 

The @channel-metadata@ permission works both ways. When associated with a specific channel or set of channels it allows you to "query the metadata of a channel":/metadata-stats/metadata/rest to request its status. When associated with the wildcard resource @'*'@ it takes on an additional meaning: as well as allowing channel status requests for all channels, it also allows you to "enumerate all active channels":/metadata-stats/metadats/rest#enumerate.
