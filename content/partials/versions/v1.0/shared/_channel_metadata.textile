This returns a "ChannelDetails":/realtime/channel-metadata#channel-details for the given channel, indicating global "occupancy":/rest/channel-status#occupancy. A side-effect of this request, in this pre-release of this API, is that it will cause the channel in question to become activated; therefore it is primarily intended to be used in conjunction with the "enumeration API":#enumeration-rest or in situations where the application has another means to know whether or not a given channel is active. A future version of this API will remove that restriction.

Example request:

bc[sh]. curl https://rest.ably.io/channels/<channelId> \
 -u "{{API_KEY}}"

The credentials presented with the request must include the @channel-metadata@ permission for the channel in question.

Client libraries currently do not support this API, but it is usable via the generic "request API":/rest/usage#request.

It is worth noting that "occupancy":/rest/channel-status#occupancy is currently only available to our "enterprise":https://www.ably.io/pricing/enterprise customers. However, you can still try and test out the occupancy events using your free account.
