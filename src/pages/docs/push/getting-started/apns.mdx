This guide will get you started with Ably Push Notifications in a new SwiftUI application.

You'll learn how to set up your `AppDelegate` to manage push notifications, register devices with Ably, send push notifications, subscribe to channel-based push, handle incoming notifications, and implement location-based push notifications.

## Prerequisites <a id="prerequisites"/>

1. [Sign up](https://ably.com/signup) for an Ably account.
2. Create a [new app](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/new), and create your first API key in the **API Keys** tab of the dashboard.
3. Your API key will need the `publish` and `subscribe` capabilities. For sending push notifications from your app, you'll also need the `push-admin` capability.
4. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
5. You'll need a real iOS device to test push notifications (the simulator doesn't support APNs).
6. Set up Apple Push Notification service (APNs) certificates through the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/).

### Set up APNs certificates <a id="setup-apns"/>

To enable push notifications, you need to configure APNs on Apple's developer portal:

1. Go to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list).
2. Create an App ID for your application (if you don't have one already).
3. Enable the Push Notifications capability for your App ID.
4. Create an APNs certificate and download it.
5. In the Ably dashboard, navigate to your app's **Notifications** tab.
6. Scroll to the **Push Notifications Setup** section and select **Configure Push**.
7. Follow the instructions to upload your APNs certificate.

### Create a Swift project with Xcode <a id="prerequisites-create-project"/>

Create a new iOS project with SwiftUI. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Apple Developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui).

1. Create a new iOS project in Xcode.
2. Select **App** as the template
3. Name the project **PushTutorial** and set the bundle identifier (such as `your.company.PushTutorial`)
4. Set the minimum iOS deployment target to iOS 15.0 or higher
5. Select SwiftUI as the interface and Swift as the language
6. Add the Ably SDK dependency to your project:

   - In Xcode, go to **File > Add Package Dependencies**
   - Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa`
   - Select the latest version and add it to your target

Update your project settings:

1. Select your project in Xcode's Project Navigator.
2. Select the target for your app.
3. Go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
4. Make sure you've selected your development team and that a provisioning profile has been created.
5. Add the **Push Notifications** capability by clicking **+ Capability**.

All code can be added directly to your `ContentView.swift` and `AppDelegate.swift` files.

## Step 1: Setting up Ably <a id="step-1"/>

Create `AppDelegate.swift` file and add the `AppDelegate` class which should conform to the following protocols: `UIApplicationDelegate`, `ARTPushRegistererDelegate`, `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`, and `CLLocationManagerDelegate`.

Set Ably realtime client, notification center, and location manager in your
`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` delegate method as shown below:

<Code>
```swift
import Ably
import UIKit
import CoreLocation
import UserNotifications

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate, ARTPushRegistererDelegate, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate, CLLocationManagerDelegate {

    // MARK: - Properties
    var realtime: ARTRealtime!
    var locationManager: CLLocationManager!

    var defaultDeviceToken: String?
    var locationDeviceToken: String?

    var activatePushCallback: ((String, ARTErrorInfo?) -> ())?
    var activateLocationPushCallback: ((String, ARTErrorInfo?) -> ())?
    var locationGrantedCallback: ((Bool) -> ())?

    // MARK: - UIApplicationDelegate Methods

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        // Initialize Ably Realtime client with push registerer delegate
        let clientOptions = ARTClientOptions(key: "{{API_KEY}}")
        clientOptions.clientId = "push-tutorial-client"
        clientOptions.pushRegistererDelegate = self
        realtime = ARTRealtime(options: clientOptions)

        // Set up notification delegate
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self

        // Setup location manager for location-based push
        locationManager = CLLocationManager()
        locationManager.delegate = self
        locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest

        return true
    }
}
```
</Code>

Here you also have some properties defined to manage device tokens and callbacks for UI which we'll use later.

## Step 2: Setting up push notifications <a id="step-2"/>

To send and receive push notifications you need to provide `ably-cocoa` with the device token received
from Apple in the `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` delegate method.
You also need to request notification permissions from the user and register your device with Ably.
To handle registration results, you'll implement the `ARTPushRegistererDelegate` methods.
Getting device details is also useful to confirm that your device is registered correctly.

Append the following code to your `AppDelegate` class:

<Code>
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    defaultDeviceToken = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%02x", UInt($0)) }.joined() // Convert device token data to a hex string
    print("Device Token registered: \(defaultDeviceToken!)")
    // Use Ably's global ARTPush method to register the device token with Ably
    ARTPush.didRegisterForRemoteNotifications(withDeviceToken: deviceToken, realtime: realtime)
}

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
    print("Failed to register for remote notifications: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    // Use Ably's global ARTPush method to handle registration failure
    ARTPush.didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError(error, realtime: realtime)
}

// MARK: - Push Notifications Methods

/// Request notification permissions from user
func requestUserNotificationAuthorization() {
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]) { granted, error in
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            if granted {
                print("Notification permissions granted")
            } else if let error = error {
                print("Notification permission error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
}

/// Activate push notifications
func activatePushNotifications(_ callback: @escaping (String, ARTErrorInfo?) -> ()) {
    activatePushCallback = callback
    // Request notification permissions
    requestUserNotificationAuthorization()
    // Activate push notifications with Ably
    realtime.push.activate()
    print("Activating push notifications...")
}

/// Deactivate push notifications
func deactivatePush() {
    realtime.push.deactivate()
    print("Deactivating push notifications...")
}

/// Get current device registration details
func getDeviceDetails(_ callback: @escaping (ARTDeviceDetails?, ARTErrorInfo?) -> ()) {
    realtime.push.admin.deviceRegistrations.get(realtime.device.id, callback: callback)
}

// MARK: - ARTPushRegistererDelegate Methods

func didActivateAblyPush(_ error: ARTErrorInfo?) {
    print("Push activation: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Success")")
    if let defaultDeviceToken {
        // Notify UI about activation result
        activatePushCallback?(defaultDeviceToken, error)
    }
}

func didDeactivateAblyPush(_ error: ARTErrorInfo?) {
    print("Push deactivation: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Success")")
}
```
</Code>

## Step 3: Receiving push notifications <a id="step-3"/>

Use `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` methods to receive push notifications.
You've set the notification center delegate in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.

Add these methods to your `AppDelegate` class:

<Code>
```swift
// MARK: - UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate Methods

/// Handle notification when app is in foreground
func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                          willPresent notification: UNNotification,
                          withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void) {
    let userInfo = notification.request.content.userInfo
    print("Notification received in foreground: \(userInfo)")

    // Display notification with banner, sound, and badge
    completionHandler([.banner, .sound, .badge])
}

/// Handle notification when user taps on it
func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                          didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse,
                          withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
    let userInfo = response.notification.request.content.userInfo
    print("Notification tapped: \(userInfo)")

    completionHandler()
}
```
</Code>

To receive messages on the channel as push notifications, you need to subscribe to the push notifications
in the channel first:

<Code>
```swift
// MARK: - Subscribe to Channels

/// Subscribe to a channel for push notifications
func subscribeToChannel(_ channelName: String) {
    let channel = realtime.channels.get(channelName)

    channel.push.subscribeDevice { error in
        if let error = error {
            print("Error subscribing to channel push: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        } else {
            print("Subscribed to push notifications on channel: \(channelName)")
        }
    }
}

/// Unsubscribe from a channel
func unsubscribeFromChannel(_ channelName: String) {
    let channel = realtime.channels.get(channelName)

    channel.push.unsubscribeDevice { error in
        if let error = error {
            print("Error unsubscribing from channel push: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        } else {
            print("Unsubscribed from push notifications on channel: \(channelName)")
        }
    }
}
```
</Code>

To test this code, you can send push notifications from the Ably dashboard or using the API (see the next step).

Alternatively, you can use Ably CLI to send push notifications.
First, [install](https://github.com/ably/cli) Ably CLI.
Then, use the following command to send a push notification using a client ID (or a device ID):

<Code>
```shell
ably push publish --client-id push-tutorial-client \
  --title "Test push" \
  --body "Hello from CLI!" \
  --data '{"foo":"bar","baz":"qux"}'
```
</Code>

Or to a channel:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels publish --api-key "{{API_KEY}}" exampleChannel1 '{"data":{"foo":"bar","baz":"qux"},"extras":{"push":{"notification":{"title":"Test push","body":"Hello from CLI!"}}}}'
```
</Code>

You need to login to the Ably CLI before running this command:

<Code>
```shell
ably login
```
</Code>


## Step 4: Sending push notifications <a id="step-4"/>

In order to send push notifications from the app you need to add `push-admin` capability for your API Key
in the Ably dashboard. Usually, push notifications are sent from your backend server, but for demonstration
purposes you can send them directly from the app using the Ably Realtime client's Push Admin API.

Add the following methods to your `AppDelegate` class:

<Code>
```swift
// MARK: - Send Push Notifications

/// Send push notification to a specific device ID
func sendPushToDevice() {
    let recipient = [
        "deviceId": realtime.device.id
    ]
    let data = [
        "notification": [
            "title": "Push Tutorial",
            "body": "Hello from device ID!"
        ],
        "data": [
            "foo": "bar",
            "baz": "qux"
        ]
    ]
    realtime.push.admin.publish(recipient, data: data) { error in
        print("Publish result: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Success")")
    }
}

/// Send push notification to a specific client ID
func sendPushToClientId() {
    let recipient = [
        "clientId": realtime.auth.clientId ?? "push-tutorial-client"
    ]
    let data = [
        "notification": [
            "title": "Push Tutorial",
            "body": "Hello from client ID!"
        ],
        "data": [
            "foo": "bar",
            "baz": "qux"
        ]
    ]
    realtime.push.admin.publish(recipient, data: data) { error in
        print("Publish result: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Success")")
    }
}
```
</Code>

You can also send push notifications by publishing a message with a `push` message's `extras` field to a specific channel:
<Code>
```swift
/// Send push notification to a specific channel by publishing a message with a push extras field
func sendPushToChannel(_ channelName: String) {
    let message = ARTMessage(name: "example", data: "Hello from channel!")
    message.extras = [
        "push": [
            "notification": [
                "title": "Channel Push",
                "body": "Sent push to \(channelName)"
            ],
            "data": [
                "foo": "bar",
                "baz": "qux"
            ]
        ]
    ] as any ARTJsonCompatible

    realtime.channels.get(channelName).publish([message]) { error in
        if let error {
            print("Error sending push to \(channelName) with error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        } else {
            print("Sent push to \(channelName)")
        }
    }
}
```
</Code>

You don't need admin capabilities to send push notifications to a channel.

## Step 5: Location pushes <a id="step-5"/>

Starting from iOS 15 you can efficiently receive location requests as push notifications.
For that you need to apply for the special entitlement on the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_location_push).

Add `Location (when in use)`, `Location (Always)`, `Location Push Service Extension`, and
`Push Notifications` capabilities to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab in the Xcode project target settings.

Add `Location Push Service Extension` target as described at the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/creating-a-location-push-service-extension).
For simplicity, use **Automatically manage signing**, so all needed identifiers are created for you by
Xcode (with XC prefix in their display name). Your Location Push Service Extension should have a bundle
identifier of your app with a suffix of extension's product name (e.g., `the.company.TheApp.TheExtension`).

Add these methods to your `AppDelegate` class:

<Code>
```swift
// MARK: - Location push methods

/// Enable location push monitoring
func enableLocationPush(grantedCallback: @escaping (Bool) -> (), tokenCallback: @escaping (String, ARTErrorInfo?) -> ()) {
    // Store callbacks since location permission request is asynchronous
    locationGrantedCallback = grantedCallback
    activateLocationPushCallback = tokenCallback

    switch locationManager.authorizationStatus {
    case .authorizedAlways:
        // Location permissions already granted
        locationGrantedCallback?(true)
        // Activate location push monitoring
        activateLocationPush()
        print("Location push enabled")
    case .notDetermined:
        // Request location permissions from user with 'Always' authorization needed for location pushes
        locationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
    case .denied, .restricted, .authorizedWhenInUse:
        locationGrantedCallback?(false)
        print("Location permission denied or restricted")
    @unknown default:
        break
    }
}

/// Disable location push monitoring
func disableLocationPush() {
    locationManager?.stopUpdatingLocation()
    print("Location push disabled")
}

/// Activate location push monitoring
func activateLocationPush() {
    print("Starting monitoring location pushes...")
    locationManager.startMonitoringLocationPushes { deviceToken, error in
        guard error == nil else {
            return ARTPush.didFailToRegisterForLocationNotificationsWithError(error!, realtime: self.realtime)
        }
        if let deviceToken {
            // Convert device token data to a hex string
            self.locationDeviceToken = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%02x", UInt($0)) }.joined()
            // Provide Ably with location device token
            ARTPush.didRegisterForLocationNotifications(withDeviceToken: deviceToken, realtime: self.realtime)
            print("Location push activated with device token: \(self.locationDeviceToken!)")
        }
    }
}

// MARK: - CLLocationManagerDelegate Methods

func locationManagerDidChangeAuthorization(_ manager: CLLocationManager) {
    switch manager.authorizationStatus {
    case .authorizedAlways:
        // Location permissions granted, activate location push monitoring
        locationGrantedCallback?(true)
        // Activate location push monitoring
        activateLocationPush()
        print("Location services always authorized.")
    case .notDetermined, .authorizedWhenInUse, .restricted, .denied:
        // Inform UI that location permissions were not granted
        locationGrantedCallback?(false)
        print("Location services unavailable for location pushes.")
        break
    default:
        break
    }
}
```
</Code>

Also add this in your `ARTPushRegistererDelegate` section.
It will be called after `ARTPush.didRegisterForLocationNotifications(withDeviceToken:realtime:)` completes:

<Code>
```swift
func didUpdateAblyPush(_ error: ARTErrorInfo?) {
    print("Push update: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Success")")
    if let locationDeviceToken {
        // Notify UI about activation result
        activateLocationPushCallback?(locationDeviceToken, error)
    }
}
```
</Code>

### Receiving location pushes <a id="step-5-receiving"/>

Once you've added location push extension to your project, Xcode gives you a default implementation of the
`LocationPushService.swift` file in your extension target.
Use `locationManager(_:didUpdateLocations)` delegate method to handle location updates as needed.

## Step 6: Displaying the results <a id="step-6"/>

Now, lets complete our `ContentView` to display all the results of everything we added above.
First, in your `PushTutorialApp.swift`, add `@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor` wrapped `appDelegate` property
to your app `@main` struct and pass it to the `ContentView`:

<Code>
```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct PushTutorialApp: App {
    @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView(appDelegate: appDelegate)
        }
    }
}
```
</Code>

Then, update your `ContentView.swift` to accept the `appDelegate` and display a few sections:

<Code>
```swift
import Ably
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    let appDelegate: AppDelegate

    @State private var statusMessage = "Ready to start"
    @State private var selectedChannel = "exampleChannel1"

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            VStack(spacing: 0) {
                // Status Section
                StatusSection(message: $statusMessage)
                .padding()

                ScrollView {
                    VStack(spacing: 16) {
                        // Setup Section
                        SetupPushSection(appDelegate: appDelegate, statusMessage: $statusMessage)

                        // Send Push Section
                        SendPushSection(appDelegate: appDelegate, statusMessage: $statusMessage, selectedChannel: $selectedChannel)

                        // Subscribe to Channel Section
                        ChannelSection(appDelegate: appDelegate, statusMessage: $statusMessage, selectedChannel: $selectedChannel)

                        // Location Push Section
                        LocationPushSection(appDelegate: appDelegate, statusMessage: $statusMessage)
                    }
                    .padding()
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Push Tutorial")
        }
    }
}
```
</Code>

Each section is implemented as a separate SwiftUI `View` struct for better organization (you can add them at the bottom of the same `ContentView.swift` file):

<Code>
```swift
// MARK: - Status Section
struct StatusSection: View {
    @Binding var message: String

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) {
            Text("Status")
                .font(.headline)

            Text(message)
                .font(.caption)
                .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
                .padding(12)
                .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
                .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.1))
                .cornerRadius(8)
        }
        .padding()
        .background(Color.white)
        .cornerRadius(12)
        .shadow(radius: 2)
    }
}

// MARK: - Setup Section
struct SetupPushSection: View {
    let appDelegate: AppDelegate
    @Binding var statusMessage: String

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 12) {
            Text("Setup")
                .font(.headline)

            VStack(spacing: 10) {
                Button(action: {
                    appDelegate.activatePushNotifications { deviceToken, error in
                        if let error = error {
                            statusMessage = "Push activation failed: \(error.localizedDescription)"
                        } else {
                            statusMessage = "Push notifications activated with device token: \(deviceToken)"
                        }
                    }
                    statusMessage = "Activating push notifications..."
                }) {
                    HStack {
                        Image(systemName: "checkmark.circle")
                        Text("Activate Push")
                    }
                    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.green)
                    .foregroundStyle(.white)
                    .cornerRadius(8)
                }

                Button(action: {
                    appDelegate.deactivatePush()
                    statusMessage = "Push notifications deactivated"
                }) {
                    HStack {
                        Image(systemName: "xmark.circle")
                        Text("Deactivate Push")
                    }
                    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.red)
                    .foregroundStyle(.white)
                    .cornerRadius(8)
