# Error 40001: Invalid request body

## What Happened

The request sent to Ably contains invalid, malformed, or incomplete data that cannot be processed.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40001 | 400 | Client Error (Validation) | No - requires fixing the request |

## Quick Fix

- Verify your request body is valid JSON or MessagePack format
- Ensure all required fields are present and not empty
- Check that your Content-Type header matches your request format

## Error Messages

You may encounter one of these specific error messages:

- "invalid request body"
- "unable to publish chat message while parsing request; cannot decode request body (ensure JSON is properly formatted)"
- "unable to publish chat message while validating request; text is empty (message text field is required and cannot be empty)"
- "Invalid token request body while parsing authentication request; no keyName specified (keyName is required for token requests)"
- "Invalid token request body while parsing authentication request; no nonce specified (nonce is required to prevent replay attacks)"
- "unable to add message reaction; type is invalid"
- "unable to add message reaction; name is empty"
- "unable to delete message reaction; type is empty"
- "invalid JSON data"
- "invalid MessagePack data"
- "invalid utf-8 data"
- "missing content-type"
- "invalid response content-type"
- "invalid room configuration: [reason]"
- "Typing heartbeatThrottle must be greater than 0"
- "cannot delete reaction of type [type] without a name"
- "Raw message reactions are not enabled"

## Common Causes

1. **Malformed request body** (40% of cases)
   - Invalid JSON syntax (missing quotes, brackets, or commas)
   - Improperly encoded MessagePack data
   - Invalid UTF-8 encoding in text fields
   - MessagePack used where only JSON is supported (e.g., LiveObjects API)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-analysis.md lines 158-176 -->

2. **Missing required fields** (35% of cases)
   - Empty `text` field in chat messages
   - Missing `keyName` in token requests
   - Missing `nonce` in non-key-authenticated token requests
   - Missing `type` or `name` in reactions
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-analysis.md lines 25-96 -->

3. **Missing or incorrect Content-Type header** (15% of cases)
   - No Content-Type header in request
   - Content-Type doesn't match actual request format
   - Using unsupported content types (plain text, form-encoded, octet-stream)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-analysis.md lines 97-112 -->

4. **Invalid configuration values** (10% of cases)
   - Non-positive typing throttle values (must be > 0)
   - Invalid reaction types
   - Incompatible room configuration options
   - Raw reactions used without enabling in room options
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-analysis.md lines 133-163 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Validate your request format**
   - Ensure your JSON is properly formatted using a JSON validator
   - Check for common syntax errors like missing quotes, commas, or brackets
   - If using MessagePack, verify your encoding is correct
   - Note: LiveObjects API currently only supports JSON, not MessagePack

   <!-- Source: Known limitation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-knowledge.md lines 186-192 -->

2. **Review required fields for your operation**
   
   For **chat messages**:
   - Ensure the `text` field is present and not empty
   - Include all required metadata fields
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-analysis.md lines 64-80 -->
   
   For **token requests**:
   - Include the `keyName` parameter
   - Add a unique `nonce` value for non-key-authenticated requests
   - Ensure timestamp is formatted as string or number
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-analysis.md lines 124-132 -->
   <!-- Source: Slack discussion from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-knowledge.md lines 289-294 -->
   
   For **reactions**:
   - Provide `type` field (required for all reactions)
   - Include `name` field for non-unique reaction types
   - Only use `count` field with "Multiple" type reactions
   - Enable raw reactions in room options before using
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-analysis.md lines 16-42 -->
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-analysis.md lines 143-145 -->

3. **Set proper HTTP headers**
   - Include `Content-Type: application/json` for JSON requests
   - Use `Content-Type: application/x-msgpack` for MessagePack (where supported)
   - Ensure character encoding is UTF-8
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-analysis.md lines 166-176 -->

4. **Check SDK-specific requirements**
   - Review the API documentation for your specific SDK
   - Verify you're using the correct method signatures
   - Ensure proper serialization settings in your language
   - Keep your SDK updated to the latest version
   <!-- Source: FAQ advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-knowledge.md lines 121-137 -->

5. **Debug with minimal payload**
   - Start with the simplest valid request
   - Gradually add optional parameters
   - Log the exact request body being sent
   - Check for batch operation error masking (40020 may hide 40001 errors)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge base recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-knowledge.md lines 115-118 -->
   <!-- Source: Batch operation pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/960659b/output/error-codes/research/40001-knowledge.md lines 295-300 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried by Ably SDKs. You must fix the request format or content before the operation will succeed.

## Prevention

- Validate all input data before sending requests to Ably
- Use strongly-typed SDK methods where available
- Implement request validation in your application layer
- Test with various payload sizes and character sets
- Be aware of API-specific limitations (e.g., LiveObjects is JSON-only)
- For batch operations, check the batchResponse field for individual errors

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Comprehensive list of which APIs support MessagePack vs JSON-only (LiveObjects issue mentioned in knowledge file)
- Impact: Developers may attempt MessagePack with unsupported endpoints, receiving confusing errors
- Recommendation: Document encoding support matrix for all APIs clearly
- Severity: Medium - causes confusion but workaround exists (use JSON)
-->
