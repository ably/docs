meta_keywords: "sports betting, live odds, realtime odds updates, message conflation, Pub/Sub pricing, betting platform, live sports data, odds streaming, realtime data delivery, Ably Pub/Sub pricing"
intro: "This example shows pricing for a sports betting data broadcast with live odds updates. It uses Ably's per-message and per-minute billing model, and demonstrates how message conflation reduces costs when only the latest value matters. The same pattern applies to any broadcast where only the latest value matters, such as stock tickers, live scores, auction platforms and transport arrivals."

## Cost breakdown

The following breakdown shows the cost of connections, channels and messages in this scenario.

### How messages are counted

Every message counts as a billable message. Messages are counted when they're published to Ably and when they're delivered to viewers. Usage is billed in increments of one million messages, rounded up.

One odds update sent to 200 viewers = 201 messages (one sent to Ably + 200 delivered to viewers).

**Reducing cost with conflation**

[Message conflation](/docs/messages#conflation) removes redundant and outdated messages by only sending the latest message to subscribers, within a specific time frame. Published messages are aggregated for a set period of time, such as every 500ms, evaluated against a conflation key with all but the most recent being discarded and sent to subscribers. For live odds, this is ideal, as users need the current price, not a history of changes.

In this example, conflation reduces outbound delivery from 10 updates/sec to 2 updates/sec (500ms interval), **saving approximately 80%** at this scale.

| Message type              | Calculation                                            | Messages    |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Sent (from data provider) | 10 updates/sec × 7,200 sec × 50 matches                | 3,600,000   |
| Delivered (to viewers)    | 2 updates/sec × 7,200 sec × 200 viewers × 50 matches   | 144,000,000 |
| **Total messages**        | 3,600,000 + 144,000,000                                | 147,600,000 |
| **Total message cost**    | 148,000,000 × $2.50/M                                  | **$370.00** |
