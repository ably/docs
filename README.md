1. Install Node 20 and Yarn 1.22

2. Clone this repository and make it your working directory.

3. Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

4. If this is the first time running the site, run `yarn run develop:env-setup` to setup your environment variables. Visit `localhost:8000` to view the site.

## Support

If you have any questions or suggestions, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ably/docs/issues).

## Website Proxy

The Website app forwards requests to `/docs` to the `docs.ably.com` site.

Asset prefixing is applied only during the app build process and is not available in the dev version.

To ensure proper setup in your local:

1. Set the `ASSET_PREFIX=http://localhost:9000` variable in your environment.
2. Add `DOCS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9000` to your `.env` file in the root of the Website app.
3. Ensure that `.env.production` exists in the app root for the Yarn build to function correctly.
4. You should be able to view the content and toggle between signed in and signed-out states.
