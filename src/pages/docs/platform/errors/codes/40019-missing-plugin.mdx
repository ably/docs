# Error 40019: Missing Plugin

## What Happened

The SDK requires a plugin or module that isn't installed or included in your build. This is part of Ably's modular architecture where advanced features are provided as optional plugins to keep the core SDK size minimal.

## Quick Reference
| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40019 | 400 | Client Error (Missing Plugin) | No - requires installing missing plugin |

## Quick Fix
- Install the missing plugin specified in the error message
- Include the plugin in your SDK initialization
- For modular builds, ensure all required plugins are imported

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Missing Vcdiff decoder (https://github.com/ably-forks/vcdiff-decoder)"
- "{pluginName} plugin not provided"
- "LiveObjects plugin hasn't been installed, add runtimeOnly('io.ably:live-objects:<ably-version>') to your dependency tree"
- "missing objects plugin"

## Common Causes

1. **VCDiff decoder not installed** (JavaScript/React Native)
   - Using delta compression without the VCDiff decoder plugin
   - Receiving messages with 'vcdiff' encoding
   - Missing TextEncoder polyfill in React Native environments
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40019-analysis.md lines 15-20 -->
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 145-149 -->

2. **LiveObjects module missing** (Java/Android)
   - Attempting to use LiveObjects features without the runtime dependency
   - Missing runtime dependency in build configuration
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40019-analysis.md lines 30-35 -->

3. **Experimental plugin not configured** (Go)
   - Using experimental objects without plugin configuration
   - Missing ExperimentalObjectsPlugin in client options
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40019-analysis.md lines 39-44 -->

4. **Modular build missing components** (JavaScript)
   - Using modular SDK build without required plugins
   - Optional features not included in custom build
   - Tree-shaking removed necessary components
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 46-48 -->

## Resolution Steps

### JavaScript/TypeScript

1. **For VCDiff decoder issues:**
   ```bash
   npm install @ably/vcdiff-decoder
   ```
   
   Then include in your application:
   ```javascript
   import vcdiff from '@ably/vcdiff-decoder';
   const client = new Ably.Realtime({ 
     key: 'your-key',
     plugins: { vcdiff }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 52-63 -->

2. **For React Native TextEncoder issues:**
   ```bash
   npm install text-encoding-polyfill
   ```
   
   Add to your index.js before any Ably imports:
   ```javascript
   import 'text-encoding-polyfill';
   ```
   <!-- Source: Slack discussion from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 144-149 -->

3. **For modular build plugins:**
   ```javascript
   import { Realtime } from 'ably/modular';
   import { 
     WebSocketTransport, 
     FetchRequest,
     // Include other required plugins based on features used
   } from 'ably/modular/plugins';
   
   const client = new Realtime({
     key: 'your-key',
     plugins: {
       WebSocketTransport,
       FetchRequest,
       // Add plugins for features you need
     }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 65-79 -->

### Java/Android

**For LiveObjects features:**

Using Gradle:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.ably:ably-android:1.x.x'
    runtimeOnly 'io.ably:live-objects:1.x.x' // Match SDK version
}
```

Using Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.ably</groupId>
    <artifactId>live-objects</artifactId>
    <version>1.x.x</version> <!-- Match SDK version -->
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 81-99 -->

### Go

**For Experimental Objects:**
```go
// Implement and configure the experimental objects plugin
opts := &ably.ClientOptions{
    Key: "your-key",
    ExperimentalObjectsPlugin: &MyObjectsPlugin{}, // Your plugin implementation
}
client, _ := ably.NewRealtime(opts)
```

## Automatic Handling

This error requires manual intervention. SDKs cannot automatically install missing plugins - you must add the required dependencies to your project.

## Prevention

- **Check documentation** for feature-specific plugin requirements before using advanced features
- **Match versions** - Ensure plugin versions match your SDK version exactly
- **Minimal builds** - Only include plugins for features you actually use to optimize bundle size
- **Test thoroughly** - Verify all required features work in development before deploying
- **Review build configuration** - Ensure build tools don't accidentally exclude required plugins

<!-- External URLs verified: 4 | Corrected: 1 | Exempted internal: 7 -->
<!-- Corrected URLs:
  - Changed https://ably.com/docs/channels#delta-compression to https://ably.com/docs/channels/options/deltas
  - Removed https://ably.com/docs/sdks/javascript#modular (404) and replaced with https://ably.com/docs/sdk/js/v2.0
-->

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Clear plugin requirements matrix showing which features require which plugins
- Missing: Modular SDK specific documentation page (javascript#modular returns 404)
- Impact: Developers don't know plugin requirements until runtime errors occur
- Recommendation: Create a comprehensive plugin requirements guide with examples
- Severity: Medium - causes runtime surprises but has clear solutions
-->

To improve this error code documentation:
1. First approach: Update editorial-notes.md in ably-os repository with specific guidance for error 40019
2. Regenerate: Run `./bin/ably-os errors document-error-codes 40019 --force`
