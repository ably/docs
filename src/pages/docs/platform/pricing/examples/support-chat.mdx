title: Enterprise support chat pricing example
meta_description: "Calculate Ably Chat pricing for enterprise customer support chat. Example shows 50K MAU, one-to-one messaging, and why consumption pricing at ~$78/month outperforms MAU pricing at $2,500/month for support use cases."
meta_keywords: "support chat, customer support, enterprise chat, one-to-one messaging, chat pricing, MAU pricing, consumption pricing, support agent chat, customer service chat, Ably Chat pricing"
intro: "This Ably Chat example demonstrates consumption-based pricing for enterprise customer support – one-to-one conversations between agents and customers. Support chat typically involves brief, infrequent sessions, making consumption-based pricing significantly more cost-effective than MAU pricing for this pattern."

## Assumptions
The scale and features used in this calculation.

| Scale | Features |
|-------|----------|
| 50,000 MAU (customers) | ✓ Typing indicators |
| 300 support agents | ✓ Presence |
| 5 conversations per customer/month (250,000 total) | ✓ History retrieval (20% of conversations, 50 messages each) |
| 20 messages per conversation | |
| 15 typing events per conversation | |
| 4 presence events per conversation | |
| 20-minute average conversation | |

These assumptions generate 27M messages, 5.53M connection minutes, and 5M channel minutes.

## Cost summary
The high-level cost breakdown for this scenario.

| Item | Calculation | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Messages | 27M × $2.50/M | $67.50 |
| Connection minutes | 5.53M × $1.00/M | $5.53 |
| Channel minutes | 5M × $1.00/M | $5.00 |
| Package fee |  | [See plans](/pricing) |
| **Total (Consumption)** |  | **~$78/month** |


## Message breakdown
How the message cost breaks down by feature. Batching has minimal impact in 1:1 chat since there's only one recipient per message – batching benefits scale with room size.

| Feature | Events | Inbound | Outbound | Total messages |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|----------------|
| Chat messages | 5,000,000 | 5,000,000 | 10,000,000 | 15,000,000 |
| Typing indicators | 3,750,000 | 3,750,000 | 3,750,000 | 7,500,000 |
| Presence | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | 2,000,000 |
| History retrieval | 50,000 requests | — | 2,500,000 | 2,500,000 |
| **Total** | | | | **27,000,000** |

**Message cost:** 27M × $2.50/M = **$67.50**

## Connection and channel minutes
How connection and channel minute costs are calculated.

| Type | Calculation | Minutes | Cost |
|------|-------------|---------|------|
| Customer connections | 250K conversations × 20 mins | 5,000,000 | $5.00 |
| Agent connections | 300 agents × avg 80 mins/day × 22 days | 528,000 | $0.53 |
| Channel minutes | 250K conversations × 20 mins | 5,000,000 | $5.00 |

### Consumption vs MAU comparison
Consumption-based pricing works better for support chat because customers connect briefly and infrequently, using far less than the Monthly Active User (MAU) allowances which are 20,000 messages and 2,000 connection minutes.

| Model | Calculation | Monthly cost |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Consumption-based | As above | ~$78 |
| MAU pricing | 50,000 MAU × $0.05 | $2,500 |
