LiveSync is a powerful realtime data synchronization product designed to broadcast realtime updates from backend databases to frontend clients at scale. Leveraging Ably Pub/Sub, LiveSync ensures that data updates are propagated reliably and in order to all connected clients in realtime.

LiveSync can be used for a variety of applications where your database is the source of truth for the application state and that state needs to be reflected in realtime on the frontend apps. LiveSync enables this data synchronisation while maintaining data integrity and low latency. Developers can build highly responsive and interactive applications by enabling optimistic updates, which is offered out of the box as a design pattern.

There are two flavours of LiveSync:

* *Postgres and Models SDK*: sync datamodels to frontend clients directly from your Postgres database in realtime. Comes with built in optimistic updates, and hooks for intial load of you datamodel's data.
* *MongoDB connector*: sync "Change Events":https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v8.0/changeStreams/ produced by MongoDB to subscribing clients in realtime.

LiveSync borrows concepts from "Event Driven Architectures":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture (EDA) to offer a flexible and reliable approach to data synchronization. By being built on top of Ably "Pub/Sub":https://ably.com/solutions/channels it automatically benefits from automatic "connection recovery":https://ably.com/docs/connect/states as well as features like "rewind":https://ably.com/docs/channels/options/rewind and "history":https://ably.com/docs/storage-history/history to make sure you don't miss messages. You can also leverage the "capabilities":https://ably.com/docs/auth/capabilities on the authentication tokens to control the access to various data models. 

Ably's platform guarantees and "four pillars of dependability":https://ably.com/four-pillars-of-dependability apply by default; performance, integrity, reliability, and availability.

h2(#channel-based-broadcasting). Channel-based broadcasting

Ably's "pub/sub channels":https://ably.com/docs/channels are the mechanism used by LiveSync for synchronizing data updates to subscribing clients. When a message is published on a channel by one of the database connectors, it is immediately broadcast to all subscribers of that channel.

h2(#pricing). Pricing

LiveSync pricing is based on message publishes and subscribes (alongside concurrent connections and concurrent channels). Each update published from the Database Connector to an Ably channel is counted as a single message. The message is then additionally counted as for each frontend client that receives that message on their channel subscription. If, for example, one update is published by the Database Connector and there are three frontend clients subscribed, you will be charged for four messages. Take a look at the "pricing page":https://ably.com/pricing for more info.

h2(#development-status). Development status

* LiveSync Postgres connector and Models SDK is in public alpha
* LiveSync MongoDB connector is in public beta

Your "feedback":https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd00n1uxgXWPGvMjKwMVL1UDhFKMeh3bSrP52j9AfXifoU-Pg/viewform will help prioritize improvements and fixes for subsequent releases. The features in this release have been validated for a set of use-cases and the alpha is implemented to work under real-world situations and load, but you should use caution when deciding under what conditions to use it.
