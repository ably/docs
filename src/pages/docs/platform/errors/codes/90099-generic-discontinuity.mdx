# Error 90099: Generic discontinuity

## What Happened?

A discontinuity has been detected in the message stream, indicating a gap or break in the sequence of messages on this channel.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 90099 | 404 | Channel Error (Discontinuity) | No - indicates a gap in message continuity |

## Quick Fix

- Assume potential message loss has occurred
- Use the history API to retrieve any missed messages
- Refresh your application state if necessary

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Generic discontinuity"

## Common Causes

1. **Artificial discontinuity for testing** (Most common)
   - Administrative testing of discontinuity handling
   - Debug endpoint triggered discontinuity
   - Simulated message gap for validation

2. **Unspecified discontinuity scenario**
   - Generic fallback when specific discontinuity type unknown
   - Catch-all for unusual continuity breaks

## Resolution Steps

1. **Handle the discontinuity in your application**
   <!-- Source: Based on analysis findings in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90099-knowledge.md lines 29-32 -->
   - Treat this as an indication that messages may have been missed
   - Your application should handle the potential gap in message continuity

2. **Retrieve missed messages if needed**
   <!-- Source: Based on analysis findings in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90099-knowledge.md lines 31-32 -->
   - Use the [history API](https://ably.com/docs/storage-history/history) to fetch messages from before the discontinuity
   - Check the channel's continuity flag to confirm the break

3. **Refresh application state**
   <!-- Source: Based on discontinuity handling best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90099-knowledge.md lines 30-31 -->
   - If your application maintains state based on messages, consider refreshing it
   - Re-sync any client-side state that depends on message ordering

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically detect discontinuities and set the channel's continuity flag to false. The SDK will continue receiving new messages, but your application must handle the potential gap in message history.

## Understanding Discontinuities

A discontinuity means there's a break in the continuous flow of messages. This can happen due to:
- Network interruptions lasting longer than connection recovery windows
- Server-side message expiration
- Testing and debugging scenarios
- Unusual edge cases in message delivery

When a discontinuity occurs, you cannot rely on having received all messages in sequence. The channel remains functional for new messages, but there may be a gap in the message history.

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Comprehensive guide on handling all discontinuity error codes (90003-90099)
- Impact: Developers may not understand the full range of discontinuity scenarios
- Recommendation: Create a dedicated discontinuity handling guide that covers all error codes
- Severity: Medium - discontinuities are important for message integrity
-->
