# Error 40010: Invalid channel name

## What Happened

The channel name or qualifier you provided doesn't meet Ably's validation requirements.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40010 | 400 | Client Error (Channel Validation) | No - requires fixing the channel name |

## Troubleshooting

### Malformed Channel Qualifier
**Symptom**: "Invalid channel name" or "Invalid qualifier in channelId"  
**Solution**: Fix the qualifier syntax - ensure proper bracket formatting
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/8f8fd9c/output/error-codes/research/40010-analysis.md lines 26-32 -->

Valid qualifiers use this format: `[qualifier]channel-name`
- `[meta]my-channel` - Channel metadata namespace
- `[presence]my-channel` - Presence operations
- `[-persisted]my-channel` - Non-persisted messages
- `[?rewind=10]my-channel` - Channel options

### Missing Channel Name After Qualifier
**Symptom**: Channel name is empty after the qualifier  
**Solution**: Add a channel name after the qualifier
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/8f8fd9c/output/error-codes/research/40010-analysis.md line 29 -->

```javascript
// ❌ Wrong: No channel name after qualifier
channel = realtime.channels.get('[meta]');

// ✅ Correct: Channel name included
channel = realtime.channels.get('[meta]my-channel');
```
<!-- Code source: https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/8f8fd9c/output/error-codes/research/40010-analysis.md lines 138-139, essential for demonstrating fix -->

### Channel Names Starting with Square Bracket
**Symptom**: Channel name starts with `[` but isn't a valid qualifier  
**Solution**: Either use proper qualifier syntax or avoid starting with `[`
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/8f8fd9c/output/error-codes/research/40010-knowledge.md lines 22-23 -->

Square brackets are reserved for channel metadata and instructions. See [Channel documentation](https://ably.com/docs/channels) for allowed patterns.

### Incompatible Channel Options
**Symptom**: "cannot use a derived option with a {type} channel"  
**Solution**: Don't apply derived options to already-qualified channels
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/8f8fd9c/output/error-codes/research/40010-analysis.md lines 42-48 -->

```javascript
// ❌ Wrong: Applying options to qualified channel
const qualified = realtime.channels.get('[meta]channel');
qualified.setOptions({ params: { rewind: '1' } });

// ✅ Correct: Include options at channel creation
const channel = realtime.channels.get('[?rewind=1]my-channel');
```
<!-- Code source: https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/8f8fd9c/output/error-codes/research/40010-analysis.md lines 144-145, demonstrates proper option usage -->

### PubNub Protocol Translation Issues
**Symptom**: Error occurs with channels from PubNub translator  
**Solution**: Ensure channel names are compatible with Ably's format when migrating from PubNub
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/8f8fd9c/output/error-codes/research/40010-knowledge.md lines 96-97 -->
