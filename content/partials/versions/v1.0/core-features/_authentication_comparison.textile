When deciding on which authentication method you will be using, it is recommended to bear in mind the "principle of least privilege":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege: a client should ideally only possess the credentials and rights that it needs to accomplish what it wants; this way, if the credentials are compromised, the rights that can be abused by an attacker are minimized.
