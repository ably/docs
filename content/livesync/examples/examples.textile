When a user adds, edits, or deletes a comment, the updates are stored in the "Postgres":https://www.postgresql.org/ database. The "Database Connector":/livesync/connector uses an outbox pattern to broadcast these changes from the database to the frontend client.

The "Models SDK":/livesync/models is subscribed to changes in the database's state and updates the frontend client. These updates are immediately reflected in the application's user interface in realtime.
