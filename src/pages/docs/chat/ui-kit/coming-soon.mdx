## Coming soon

The Ably Chat React UI Components library! A component library built specifically for the [`@ably/chat`](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js) SDK.
We’re actively developing new features and improvements to make building chat applications with Ably even easier.

## Roadmap

### Quick Start – Plug-and-Play App

The package ships with a high-level `App` component that wraps the core chat window, theming, and providers.
All you need is a configured `ChatClient` and an Ably `Realtime` instance:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { App } from 'ably-chat-react-ui-components';
import { ChatClient } from '@ably/chat';
import { AblyProvider } from 'ably/react';
import * as Ably from 'ably';

const realtimeClient = new Ably.Realtime('ably-token');
const chatClient = new ChatClient(realtimeClient);
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <AblyProvider client={realtimeClient}>
        <App chatClient={chatClient}/>
    </AblyProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>);
```

### Enhanced Customization
We’re adding some pre-defined layout options and style variants, but these will eventually be
customizable via CSS variables and props to allow for easy theming and styling.

### Additional Components
Expect emoji pickers, room management, presence, typing indicators, and more.

### Accessibility
Accessibility for things like keyboard navigation, screen-reader support, and more will be supported.
