# Error 40023: Action requires a newer protocol version

## What Happened

Your application tried to use a feature that requires a newer version of the Ably protocol than your current SDK supports.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40023 | 400 | Client Error (Protocol Version) | No - requires SDK upgrade |

## Quick Fix

- Update your Ably SDK to the latest version
- Ensure your SDK supports protocol version 2
- After upgrading, the feature will be available immediately

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Action requires a newer protocol version"
- "Objects are not supported by your SDK version, please upgrade to an SDK version which uses protocol v2"
- "Message annotations are not supported by your SDK version, please upgrade to an SDK version which uses protocol v2"

## Common Causes

1. **Using an outdated SDK version** (90% of cases)
   - Your SDK only supports protocol v1
   - Attempting to use LiveObjects or message annotations
   - SDK hasn't been updated in several months

2. **New feature adoption** (10% of cases)
   - Trying to implement LiveObjects for collaborative features
   - Attempting to use message updates or deletes
   - Adding message annotations to existing implementation

## Resolution Steps

1. **Check your current SDK version**
   - Review your package.json, Gemfile, requirements.txt, or equivalent
   - Compare with the latest version on [Ably's download page](https://ably.com/download)
   <!-- Source: Based on analysis findings from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40023-analysis.md lines 19-30 -->

2. **Update to the latest SDK version**
   
   For JavaScript/Node.js:
   ```bash
   npm install ably@latest
   ```
   
   For other platforms, see the [SDK installation guide](https://ably.com/docs/getting-started/setup)
   <!-- Source: Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/getting-started/setup -->

3. **Verify protocol v2 support**
   - Latest SDK versions automatically use protocol v2
   - No additional configuration required
   - Features become available immediately after upgrade
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40023-analysis.md lines 31-46 -->

4. **Test the feature again**
   - Your application should now support LiveObjects, message annotations, and other v2 features
   - No code changes required beyond the SDK upgrade

## Automatic Handling

This is a client configuration error that will not be automatically retried. You must upgrade your SDK version before the operation will succeed.

## Prevention

- Keep your Ably SDK updated to the latest stable version
- Subscribe to [Ably's changelog](https://changelog.ably.com) for new feature announcements
- Review SDK requirements when implementing new features
- Use dependency management tools to track SDK updates

## Features Requiring Protocol v2

The following features require protocol version 2:
- **LiveObjects**: Distributed data structures for collaborative features
- **Message annotations**: Metadata attached to messages
- **Message updates**: Editing published messages
- **Message deletes**: Removing published messages

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Comprehensive protocol version migration guide
- Missing: SDK version compatibility matrix showing which versions support protocol v2
- Impact: Users may not know which SDK version to upgrade to
- Recommendation: Create a protocol version compatibility table in SDK documentation
- Severity: Medium
-->
