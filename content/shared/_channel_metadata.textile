The REST API now includes the endpoint:

```[sh]
  GET /channels/<channelId>
```

Returns a "ChannelDetails":/general/channel_lifecycle#channel-details for the given channel, indicating global occupancy. A side-effect of this request, in this pre-release of this API, is that it will cause the channel in question to become activated; therefore it is primarily intended to be used in conjunction with the "enumeration API":#enumeration-rest or in situations where the application has another means to know whether or not a given channel is active. A future version of this API will remove that restriction.

The credentials presented with the request must include the @list-channels@ permission for the channel in question.

Client libraries do not currently support this API, but it is usable via the generic "request API":/rest/usage#request.
