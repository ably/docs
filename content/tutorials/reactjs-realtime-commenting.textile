In this tutorial, we will see how to use Ably "Realtime client library":/realtime to build a realtime commenting system with React. We'll be making use Ably's public channel. Once a comment is made, we'll publish it to the public channel. We will also be subscribed to the channel so we can see comments as they are added in realtime.

This tutorial will not include any server-side implementation. Hence, comments won't be persisted to any storage.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is component-based and declarative which makes it easy to build complex UI with it. For more information on React, please refer to their official website "https://reactjs.org":https://reactjs.org.

h2. Step 2 - Create a React App

We'll start by creating a new React app. To do this, we'll be using "create-react-app":https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app. create-react-app allows you to create a React app without having to worry about build configurations. To use it, you'll need to install @create-react-app@ locally if you don't have it already:

```[sh]
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Once installed, we can use it to create a new React app. We'll call it @reactjs-realtime-commenting@:

```[sh]
create-react-app reactjs-realtime-commenting
```

The new React app is ready. We can start it by running:

```[sh]
cd reactjs-realtime-commenting
npm start
```

This builds the static site, runs a web server and opens a browser. If your browser does not open, navigate to "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000.

h2. Step 3 - Delete Unused Files

Before we move on to building upon this app, let’s quickly delete some files we won’t be needing. Run the command below to do so:

```[sh]
rm src/App.css src/App.test.js src/index.css src/logo.svg
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step3

h2. Step 4 - Create Component Folder

Now, we’ll create a new folder within the @src@  folder called @components@. This folder will contain all our React components.

```[sh]
mkdir src/components
```

Once that is created, we need to move @App.js@ into the @components@ folder:

```[sh]
mv src/App.js src/components
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step4

h2. Step 5 - Remove References To Unused Files

Since we have deleted and moved some files which are still being referenced in @src/index.js@ and @src/App.js@, we need to update these files to not reference the deleted and moved files. Firstly, update @src/index.js@ as below:

```[javascript]
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './components/App';
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
registerServiceWorker();
```

Next, update @src/components/App.js@ as below:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">

      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step5

h2. Step 6 - Add Bulma CSS Framework

We’ll be using "Bulma":https://bulma.io CSS framework so as not to waste time writing CSS. We'll reference it from CDN (Content Delivery Network). Add the line below to the @<head>@ section of @public/index.html@:

```[html]
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.6.0/css/bulma.min.css">
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step6

h2. Step 7 - Install Ably

To start using Ably you first need to install the NPM module. The NPM module can be installed as follows:

```[sh]
npm install ably --save
```

The client library must be instanced with the API key you copied in Step 1. Note in production we recommend you always use the "token authentication scheme":https://www.ably.io/documentation/core-features/authentication#token-authentication for browser clients, however in this example we use an API key for simplicity. We’ll create a dedicated file for this and instantiate a global @Ably@ instance so we can easily use it in multiple places. Within @src@ folder, create a new file named @ably.js@ and add the code below into it:

```[javascript]
import { Realtime } from 'ably/browser/static/ably-commonjs.js';

window.Ably = new Realtime('INSERT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE');
```

Next, let's reference the file created above in @src/index.js@:

```[javascript]
require('./ably');
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step7

h2. Step 8 - Create CommentBox Component

Within the @components@ folder, create a new file named @CommentBox.js@ and add the code below into it:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class CommentBox extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1 className="title">Kindly leave your thoughts below</h1>
        <form onSubmit={this.addComment}>
          <div className="field">
            <div className="control">
              <input type="text" className="input" name="name" placeholder="Your name"/>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="field">
            <div className="control">
              <textarea className="textarea" name="comment" placeholder="Add a comment"></textarea>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="field">
            <div className="control">
              <button className="button is-primary">Submit</button>
            </div>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default CommentBox;
```

This component renders a comment form. Once the form is submitted, we trigger an @onSubmit@ event which in turn calls @addComment()@. The form won't do anything for now as we are yet to create @addComment()@.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step8

h2. Step 9 - Adding and Publishing Comment

Next, we'll create @addComment()@. Still within @components/CommentBox.js@, add the code below just before @render()@:

```[javascript]
addComment(e) {
  // Prevent the default behaviour of form submit
  e.preventDefault();

  // Get the value of the comment box
  // and make sure it not some empty strings
  const comment = e.target.elements.comment.value.trim();
  const name = e.target.elements.name.value.trim();

  // Make sure name and comment boxes are filled
  if (name && comment) {
    const commentObject = { name, comment };

    this.props.handleAddComment(commentObject);

    // Publish comment
    /*global Ably*/
    const channel = Ably.channels.get('comments');
    channel.publish('add_comment', commentObject, err => {
      if (err) {
        console.log('Unable to publish message; err = ' + err.message);
      }
    });

    // Clear input fields
    e.target.elements.comment.value = '';
    e.target.elements.name.value = '';
  }
}
```

We first prevent the default form submission behaviour (that is, reloading the page). We then get the form inputs entered (name and comment) and make sure they are not just some empty strings. If the inputs are properly filled, we add the comment just made to the array of comments. Then we publish the comment just made to a @comments@ channel with an @add_comment@ event. Adding @/*global Ably*/@ tells ESlint that we are using the global variable (@Ably@) we defined earlier. With this, we won't get the Eslint error: @'Ably' is not defined  no-undef@. Lastly, we clear the form fields.

Next, let's bind @addComment()@ to the @this@ keyword by adding this line to the @constructor()@ just after @super()@:

```[javascript]
this.addComment = this.addComment.bind(this);
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step9

h2. Step 10 - Create Comment Component

Within the @components@ folder, create a new file named @Comment.js@ and add the code below into it:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Comment extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <article className="media">
        <figure className="media-left">
          <p className="image is-64x64">
           <img src="https://bulma.io/images/placeholders/128x128.png" alt="Avatar" />
          </p>
        </figure>
        <div className="media-content">
          <div className="content">
            <p>
              <strong>{this.props.comment.name}</strong>
              <br />
              {this.props.comment.comment}
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </article>
    );
  }
}

export default Comment;
```

This component renders a single comment. It accepts the comment as props. Props are custom attributes that are used to pass input data to components.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step10

h2. Step 11 - Create Comments Component

Within the @components@ folder, create a new file named @Comments.js@ and add the code below into it:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Comment from './Comment';

class Comments extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <section className="section">
        {
          this.props.comments.map((comment, index) => {
            return <Comment key={index} comment={comment} />
          })
        }
      </section>
    );
  }
}

export default Comments;
```

This component accepts a @comments@ props and renders the Comment component for each of the comments available. It passes the actual comment to the Comment component as props.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step11

h2. Step 12 - Create App Component

The App component will serve as the parent component. This means the App component will contain other components which will be nested within it. Open @components/App.js@ and replace it content with the code below:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import CommentBox from './CommentBox';
import Comments from './Comments';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      comments: []
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <section className="section">
        <div className="container">
          <div className="columns">
            <div className="column is-half is-offset-one-quarter">
              <CommentBox />
              <Comments comments={this.state.comments} />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

This contains the components we created earlier. We define a @comments@ state which is an array of comments. It defaults to an empty array. This will be updated as we add comment through the comment form. Also, we pass the @comments@ state as props to the Comments component. This is how the Comments component get the comments it renders.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step12

h2. Step 13 - Updating State With Newly Added Comment

Recall from step 9 above, we called @handleAddComment()@ which is responsible for adding a new comment to @state@. But we are yet to create this function, let's do that now. Within @components/App.js@, add the code below just before @render()@:

```[javascript]
handleAddComment(comment) {
  this.setState(prevState => {
    return {
      comments: prevState.comments.concat(comment)
    };
  });
}
```

The code above adds the comment that was made to @state@. This way, the comments list is updated with new comments in realtime.

Next, still within @components/App.js@, let’s bind @handleAddComment()@ to the @this@ keyword by adding this line to the @constructor()@ just after @super()@:

```[javascript]
this.handleAddComment = this.handleAddComment.bind(this);
```

Also, still within @components/App.js@, pass @handleAddComment@ as props to @CommentBox@ component as below:

```[javascript]
<CommentBox handleAddComment={this.handleAddComment} />
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step13

h2. Step 14 - Configure all channels within a namespace to persist messages to disk

We’ll be using Ably's "history feature":/realtime/history to display our comments in realtime. Before we can make use of the history feature, we need to first configure our channel to persist messages to disk. Channels can be named using any unicode string characters with the only restriction that they cannot start with a @[@ or @:@ character as these are used as "special" characters. A colon @:@ is used to delimit channel namespaces in a format such as @namespace:channel@. Namespaces provide a flexible means to group channels together. Channel grouping can be useful when, for example, "configuring permissions (capabilities) for a set of channels within a client token":/core-features/authentication#capabilities-explained or setting up rules to apply to one or more channels.

We will be using channel rules in this tutorial to ensure all channels in the @persisted@ namespace are configured to persist messages to disk i.e. we will explicitly enable the history feature. Follow these steps:

# Visit your "account dashboard":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000048664-how-do-i-access-my-account-dashboard, navigate to the same app you chose in Step 1 when obtaining your API key earlier
# Click on the Settings tab and scroll down to the "Channel rules" section
# Click the "Add new rule" button (see below)
<a href="/images/tutorials/history/channel-rules-add-new-rule.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/history/channel-rules-add-new-rule.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Add new channel rule screenshot">
</a>
# Once the modal has opened, enter "persisted" for the namespace, check the Persisted check box to enable history, and click the "Create channel rule" button (see below)
<a href="/images/tutorials/history/channel-rules-create-modal.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/history/channel-rules-create-modal.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Create channel rule screenshot">
</a>

You have now enabled history for all channels in the @persisted@ namespace i.e. any channel with a name matching the pattern @persisted:*@ will store published messages to disk.

h2. Step 15 - Displaying Comments

We have seen how we can publish newly added comments. Now, we need to display those comments being published in realtime. We'll do this with a React lifecycle @componentDidMount()@ hook. Still within @components/App.js@, add the code below just before @handleAddComment()@:

```[javascript]
componentDidMount() {
  /*global Ably*/
  const channel = Ably.channels.get('comments');

  channel.attach();
    channel.once('attached', () => {
      channel.history((err, page) => {
        // create a new array with comments only in an reversed order (i.e old to new)
        const comments = Array.from(page.items, item => item.data)

        this.setState({ comments });

        channel.subscribe((msg) => {
          const commentObject = msg.data;
          this.handleAddComment(commentObject);
        })
      });
    });
}
```

The @componentDidMount()@ hook runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. It is a good place to fetch our comments from the @comments@ history. We connect to the @comments@ channel and listen for the @attached@ event. Then we update the @comments@ state with the comment pulled from history.

Once we've obtained the history of the channel, we then @subscribe@ to new messages on the channel. Whenever a new message is sent on the channel, we will add a new comment using @handleAddComment@.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/tree/reactjs-commenting-step15

  <img src="/images/tutorials/react-commenting/reactjs-realtime-commenting-final-output.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Final output screenshot">
</a>

That’s it. We now have a realtime commenting system. To test it out, start the app:

```[sh]
npm start
```

Then open "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000 in two different browser tabs. Add a comment in one of the opened tabs and watch the other tab update with the comment in realtime.

h2. Download tutorial source code
