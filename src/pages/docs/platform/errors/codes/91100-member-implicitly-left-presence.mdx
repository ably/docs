# Error 91100: Member implicitly left presence channel

## What Happened

A presence member was automatically removed from a channel when their connection ended unexpectedly, the system detected an inconsistent state, or server topology changes occurred.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 91100 | 400 | Presence/Channel (Realtime) | No - indicates automatic cleanup already completed |

## Quick Fix

- This is an informational error indicating automatic presence cleanup
- No action required - the system has already removed the member
- Update your UI to reflect the member's departure
- Monitor frequency if occurring regularly

## Error Messages

You may see one of these message variations in presence leave events:
- "Member implicitly left presence channel (connection closed)" - Most common, connection terminated
- "Member implicitly left presence channel (no owners)" - Presence member has no owning server instances
- "Member implicitly left presence channel (every owning instance removed)" - All servers managing this member are gone
- "Member implicitly left presence channel (unexpected owning instance)" - Server role mismatch detected
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-analysis.md lines 18-46 -->

## Common Causes

1. **Unexpected disconnection** (70% of cases)
   - Client lost network connectivity
   - Application crashed or was forcefully terminated
   - Browser tab or mobile app was closed without cleanup
   - Network timeout or WebSocket connection dropped (code 1006)
   - Device went to sleep or lost power

2. **Server topology changes** (20% of cases)
   - Frontend server deployment or rolling restart
   - Server instance migration or failover
   - Regional failover events
   - Load balancer topology updates
   - Planned maintenance activities
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-knowledge.md lines 56-62 and lines 147-152 -->

3. **Validation and consistency checks** (10% of cases)
   - Presence set inconsistency detected during periodic validation
   - Ownership validation failed (orphaned members)
   - Cross-region synchronization issues
   - Members leaked between regions during connection migration
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-analysis.md lines 57-62 and Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-knowledge.md lines 175-179 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Understand this is automatic cleanup**
   - Ably has already removed the member from the presence set
   - No manual intervention is needed or possible
   - The system is working as designed to maintain consistency
   - This distinguishes ungraceful disconnections from explicit leaves
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-knowledge.md lines 29-41 and Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-analysis.md lines 84-89 -->

2. **Handle in your presence subscriber**
   ```javascript
   channel.presence.subscribe('leave', (member) => {
     if (member.reason?.code === 91100) {
       // Member left unexpectedly (connection lost, crash, etc.)
       console.log(`${member.clientId} disconnected unexpectedly`);
       
       // Update UI the same as for explicit leaves
       removeUserFromUI(member.clientId);
       
       // Optional: Track for monitoring/analytics
       trackImplicitLeave(member.clientId, member.reason.message);
     }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Code pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-knowledge.md lines 65-73 - preserved from knowledge base for handling pattern -->

3. **For debugging frequent implicit leaves**
   - Check client-side connection stability and network quality
   - Monitor for patterns (specific times, regions, or users)
   - Review application lifecycle handling (especially mobile)
   - Ensure proper cleanup on app termination
   - Check for WebSocket connection issues (firewall, proxy)
   - Review server deployment schedules if correlated with timing
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-knowledge.md lines 75-80 and lines 147-152 -->

4. **Monitor as a health indicator**
   - High frequency of 91100 errors may indicate:
     - Network infrastructure issues
     - Client application stability problems
     - Aggressive device power management
     - Server deployment or topology issues
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-knowledge.md lines 83-85 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably automatically:
- Detects when presence members lose connection unexpectedly
- Removes them from the presence set after connection timeout
- Broadcasts leave events with error code 91100 to all subscribers
- Maintains presence set consistency across all regions
- Handles server topology changes transparently
- Performs periodic validation to detect and clean up orphaned members

No retry is needed or possible - the member has already been removed from presence.

## Code Examples

### Comprehensive Presence Handling
```javascript
// Initialize presence with proper error handling
const channel = ably.channels.get('chat-room');

// Enter presence with data
await channel.presence.enter({
  name: 'John Doe',
  status: 'online'
});

// Subscribe to all presence events
channel.presence.subscribe((presenceMsg) => {
  switch (presenceMsg.action) {
    case 'enter':
      addUserToUI(presenceMsg.clientId, presenceMsg.data);
      break;
      
    case 'leave':
      // Handle both explicit and implicit leaves
      if (presenceMsg.reason?.code === 91100) {
        console.log(`Implicit leave: ${presenceMsg.clientId}`);
        // Log the specific reason for debugging
        console.log(`Reason: ${presenceMsg.reason.message}`);
      }
      removeUserFromUI(presenceMsg.clientId);
      break;
      
    case 'update':
      updateUserInUI(presenceMsg.clientId, presenceMsg.data);
      break;
  }
});

// Implement graceful shutdown to prevent implicit leaves
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', async () => {
  try {
    await channel.presence.leave();
  } catch (e) {
    // Best effort - connection may already be closed
  }
});
```

## Prevention

To minimize implicit leaves:

1. **Implement graceful shutdown**
   ```javascript
   // Browser/web applications
   window.addEventListener('beforeunload', async () => {
     await channel.presence.leave();
   });
   
   // Node.js applications
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     await channel.presence.leave();
     process.exit(0);
   });
   
   // Mobile applications - handle app lifecycle
   // (iOS/Android specific handlers needed)
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-knowledge.md lines 82-86 - best practice for cleanup -->

2. **Handle connection lifecycle properly**
   - Monitor connection state changes for early detection
   - Implement appropriate reconnection logic
   - Use presence heartbeats for critical applications
   - Consider connection state recovery features
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-knowledge.md lines 81-86 -->

3. **Design for implicit leaves**
   - Treat implicit and explicit leaves identically in UI
   - Don't show error messages to users for implicit leaves
   - Consider it normal behavior in distributed systems
   - Implement "last seen" timestamps as a fallback
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/91100-analysis.md lines 63-68 -->

## Performance Impact

This error has minimal performance impact:
- Cleanup happens automatically server-side
- No additional network requests required
- Presence set remains consistent
- Other channel operations continue normally
- Does not affect message publishing or subscriptions
