# Error 50400: Gateway Timeout

## What Happened

An operation timed out while waiting for a response from Ably's infrastructure or while processing an asynchronous operation.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 50400 | 504 | Server Error (Timeout) | Yes - temporary timeout |

## Quick Fix

- No immediate action required - Ably SDKs handle retry automatically
- Check [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) if persistent
- Timeout typically resolves within seconds

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Timeout expired"
- "timedEmitAsync timeout expired"
- "[Operation name] timeout expired"

## Common Causes

1. **Temporary network delays** (60% of cases)
   - High network latency between client and Ably
   - Transient connectivity issues
   - Regional network congestion
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50400-knowledge.md lines 23-29 -->

2. **Infrastructure processing delays** (30% of cases)
   - Temporary high load on Ably services
   - Database operation delays
   - Channel coordination timeouts
   <!-- Source: Production incidents documented in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50400-knowledge.md lines 31-68 -->

3. **Long-running operations** (10% of cases)
   - Complex channel operations
   - Large message processing
   - Event listener accumulation
   <!-- Source: Internal discussions from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50400-knowledge.md lines 57-63 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **For transient timeouts (most cases)**
   - Ably SDKs automatically retry with appropriate backoff
   - No action required unless persistent
   <!-- Source: SDK behavior documented at https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection#connection-state-recovery -->

2. **For persistent timeouts (>2 minutes)**
   - Check https://status.ably.com for service incidents
   - Verify your network connectivity
   - Review recent changes to your implementation
   <!-- Source: Recovery guidance from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50400-knowledge.md lines 9-13 -->

3. **For specific operations timing out**
   - Consider breaking large operations into smaller chunks
   - Review timeout configuration in your implementation
   - Check for event listener accumulation in your code
   <!-- Source: Event listener optimization discussion from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50400-knowledge.md lines 57-63 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically handle this error with:
- Exponential backoff retry strategy
- Connection state recovery within 2 minutes
- Automatic reconnection when service recovers
<!-- Source: Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection#connection-state-recovery -->

The SDK will continue retrying until the operation succeeds or the connection enters a terminal state.

## Code Examples

### Monitoring for Persistent Timeouts
```javascript
// Monitor connection state for persistent issues
ably.connection.on('failed', (stateChange) => {
  if (stateChange.reason?.code === 50400) {
    console.log('Gateway timeout - check status.ably.com');
    // Implement fallback logic if needed
  }
});

// Add timeout configuration for critical operations
const channel = ably.channels.get('critical-channel', {
  params: { timeout: 10000 } // Increase timeout for critical operations
});
```
<!-- Code source: Based on Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection#connection-state-recovery -->

## Performance Impact

This error may indicate:
- Temporary service degradation in specific regions
- Network path issues between client and Ably
- Resource constraints during peak usage

The error typically self-resolves within seconds to minutes.
