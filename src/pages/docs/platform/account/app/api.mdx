View the information on each key's capabilities and restrictions, create new keys, and manage existing ones.

<Aside data-type='note'>
Before setting up multiple API keys with different permissions or sharing API keys with untrusted parties, consider using [token authentication](/docs/auth/token) instead. Token authentication provides more flexible access control and better security for client-side applications.

## Create a new API key <a id="create"/>

The following steps create a new API Key:

* Click **Create a new API key**.
  * Assign a friendly name.
  * Give the new API key a descriptive name (e.g. chat app key) so it is easy to identify later.

To manage an API key: set [capabilities](/docs/auth/capabilities), define resource restrictions, use revocable tokens for security, and adjust key settings as needed.

### Capabilities

[Capabilities](/docs/auth/capabilities) provide permissions required for managing message flow, user presence, notifications, channel information, and access controls, these depend on what you require the API key to have access to:

| Capability | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Publish** | Allow clients to publish messages to channels. |
| **Subscribe** | Allow clients to receive messages and presence state changes. |
| **History** | Allow clients to retrieve message and presence history. |
| **Presence** | Allow clients to register presence on a channel. |
| **Channel metadata** | Allow clients to query channel metadata. |
| **Push admin and push-subscribe** | Allow clients to manage and subscribe to push notifications. |
| **Statistics** | Allow clients to query usage statistics. |
| **Privileged headers** | Allow clients to set privileged headers, such as to skip channel rules. |

### Set resource restrictions

Set resource restrictions to control access to channels and queues, ranging from unrestricted access to specific, rule-based permissions:

| Restriction | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| None | No restrictions; access any channel or queue. |
| Only channels | Access any channel but not queues. |
| Only queues | Access any queue but not channels. |
| Selected channels and queues | Specify explicit rules for access. |

When specifying selected channels and queues, you can provide a comma-separated list of resources. Each resource can match a single channel (e.g., `channel-name`) or multiple channels using wildcards (e.g., `namespace:*`). Queues use the prefix `[queue]` and meta channels use `[meta]`. See [capabilities documentation](/docs/auth/capabilities#wildcards) for detailed wildcard syntax.

<Aside data-type='important'>
A single API key cannot support complex permission combinations, such as publish access on one channel and subscribe access on another. For such requirements, use [token authentication](/docs/auth/token) instead.

### Revocable tokens

[Revocable tokens](/docs/auth/revocation#revocable-tokens) enhance security by allowing shorter token lifetimes and the ability to revoke tokens issued via the API key.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Revocable tokens | Implement security measures by setting shorter token lifetimes and enabling the ability to revoke tokens issued by the API key. |

### Change your API key settings

Click **Settings** on the required API key to change its settings. The same settings apply as when creating a new API key.
