```
</Code>

Use the `ably channels presence enter` command to enter the presence set of a channel. Presence is used to indicate the 'online status' or 'presence' of a client to other clients on the channel.

Use another terminal instance and the [`ably channels presence subscribe`](/docs/cli/channels/presence/subscribe) command to monitor presence events.

## Arguments

Pass the following argument to the `ably channels presence enter` command:

### `<channel>` <a id="channel"/>

The channel name to enter presence on, for example: `example-channel`.

## Flags

You can optionally pass the following flags to the `ably channels presence enter` command:

### `--duration | -D` <a id="duration"/>

Automatically exit after the given number of seconds. Set to `0` to run indefinitely. The default is `0`.

### `--data` <a id="data"/>

Optional JSON data to associate with the presence entry, for example: `{"status":"online","role":"admin"}`.

## Global flags

The following global flags are supported using the `ably channels presence enter` command:

* [`--token`](/docs/cli#token)
* [`--json`](/docs/cli#json)
* [`--pretty-json`](/docs/cli#pretty-json)
* [`--api-key`](/docs/cli#api-key)
* [`--access-token`](/docs/cli#access-token)
* [`--client-id`](/docs/cli#client-id)
* [`--env`](/docs/cli#env)
* [`--host`](/docs/cli#host)
* [`--endpoint`](/docs/cli#endpoint)
* [`--verbose`](/docs/cli#verbose)

## Output

When you enter the presence set of a channel using the CLI, you'll see a list of members currently present.

The actions associated with each event are:

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Enter | A client has entered the presence set. |
| Update | A client has updated their presence data. |
| Leave | A client has left the presence set. |
| Present | A client is currently present. This is used to list the members currently in the presence set when a client first joins. |
