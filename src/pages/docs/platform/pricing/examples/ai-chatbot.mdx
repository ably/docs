### Assumptions

The scale and features used in this calculation.

| Scale | Features |
|-------|----------|
| 4 user prompts to get to resolution | ✓ Message-per-response |
| 250 tokens per LLM response | |
| 70 appends per second from agent | |
| 3 minute average chat duration | |
| 1 million chats | |

### Cost summary

The high level cost breakdown for this scenario. Messages are billed for both inbound (published to Ably) and outbound (delivered to subscribers). Creating the "Message updates and deletes" [channel rule](/docs/ai-transport/features/token-streaming/message-per-response#enable) will automatically enable message persistence.

| Item | Calculation | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Messages | 1092M × $2.50/M | $2730.00 |
| Connection minutes | 6M × $1.00/M | $6.00 |
| Channel minutes | 3M × $1.00/M | $3.00 |
| Package fee |  | [See plans](/pricing) |
| **Total** |  | **~$2739.00/M chats** |

### Message breakdown

How the message cost breaks down. The message-per-response pattern includes [automatic rollup of append events](/docs/ai-transport/features/token-streaming/token-rate-limits#per-response) to reduce consumption costs and avoid rate limits.

| Type | Calculation | Inbound | Outbound | Total messages | Cost |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|----------------|------|
| User prompts | 1M chats × 4 prompts | 4M | 4M | 8M | $20.00 |
| Agent responses | 1M chats x 4 responses x 250 token events per response | 360M | 360M | 720M | $1800.00 |
| Persisted messages | Every inbound message is persisted | 364M | 0 | 364M | $910.00 |

### Effect of append rollup

The calculation above uses the default append rollup window of 40ms, chosen to control costs with minimum impact on responsiveness. For a text chatbot use case, you could increase the window to 200ms without noticably impacting the user experience.

| Rollup window | Inbound response messages | Total messages | Cost |
|---------------|---------------------------|----------------|------|
| 40ms | 360 per chat | 1092M | $2730.00/M chats |
| 100ms | 144 per chat | 444M | $1110.00/M chats |
| 200ms | 72 per chat | 228M | $570.00/M chats |
