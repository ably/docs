<Aside data-type="note">
The `ably channel-rule` command group is a legacy alias for `ably apps channel-rules`. Use [`ably apps channel-rules`](/docs/cli/apps/channel-rules) for new implementations.
</Aside>

Use the `ably channel-rule` command group to manage [channel rules](/docs/channels/channel-rules-namespaces) (also known as namespaces) for your Ably applications. Channel rules allow you to configure permissions and settings for groups of channels based on naming patterns.

## Migration Notice

This command group is deprecated. Use the following modern equivalents:
