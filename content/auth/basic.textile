title: Basic authentication
meta_description: "Basic authentication allows you to authenticate a secure server using an Ably API key and secret."
---

Every Ably app has one or more private API keys that you set up and "configure via the dashboard":https://ably.com/dashboard. These keys can be used to authenticate with Ably. 

*Note:* It is recommended that private API keys are never shared with untrusted parties, and as such, should only be used by your trusted secure servers when authenticating with Ably.

h2. What is basic authentication?

Basic authentication is the simplest way to authenticate with Ably. This is demonstrated in the following code:

bc[javascript]. const ably = new Ably.Rest({ key: '{{API_KEY}}' });

h2. Basic authentication architecture diagram

The process used by client library SDKs to authenticate with Ably using basic authentication is illustrated in the following diagram:

h2. When to use basic authentication

Ably recommends that basic authentication is only used server-side because of the following potential issues:

* The secret is passed directly by the client to Ably, so it is only permitted for connections that are over TLS, to prevent the key secret being intercepted.
* All of the configured "capabilities":/auth/capabilities of the key are implicitly possible in any request, and clients that legitimately obtain this key may then abuse the rights for that key.
* A client that authenticates using an API key can claim any client ID it chooses. Therefore this client ID cannot be trusted to represent the genuine identity of the client. Client IDs should be assigned by the server, once the client's credentials have been authenticated.

<!-- CAVEAT-INPUT: Realtime library is not required for basic authentication -->

h2. Realtime library is not required for basic authentication

Note that when selecting a client library SDK for implementing basic authentication with Ably, you don't need to use the realtime library. 

As basic authentication is primarily designed for authenticating a secure server, in this situation, and assuming the server is only used for authentication, it is more efficient to use the Rest library, as the overhead associated with maintaining a realtime connection, is not required.
