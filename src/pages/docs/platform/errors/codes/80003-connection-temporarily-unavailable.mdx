# Error 80003: Connection temporarily unavailable

## What Happened?

Your app temporarily lost its connection to Ably, which is completely normal and happens regularly in network communication.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 80003 | 400/408/500/503 | Connection (Disconnection) | Yes - automatically handled by SDKs |

## Quick Fix

- No action required - the SDK automatically reconnects within 15 seconds
- Monitor if disconnections are excessive (multiple times per minute)
- Ensure your app handles brief disconnections gracefully

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Connection to server temporarily unavailable"
- "Connection temporarily unavailable"
- "Websocket closed"
- "Transport operation timed out"
- "Unable to connect (network unreachable)"
- "Unable to connect (no available host)"
- "No activity seen from realtime in {interval}; assuming connection has dropped"
- "Transport disconnected unexpectedly"
- "Connection timeout after 3 seconds" (CLI only)
- "No network connection available" (Android)
- "Idle timer expired"

## Common Causes

1. **Normal network interruptions** (80% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80003-knowledge.md lines 11-19 -->
   - Brief WiFi hiccups or network maintenance
   - Cell tower handoffs on mobile devices
   - Network equipment resets or updates

2. **Mobile device behavior** (15% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80003-knowledge.md lines 13-19 -->
   - Switching between WiFi and cellular data
   - Device sleep/wake cycles
   - Background app transitions
   - Battery optimization pausing network activity

3. **Authentication updates** (5% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80003-analysis.md lines 62-63 -->
   - Token renewal causing momentary disconnection
   - Credential updates requiring reconnection

## Resolution Steps

1. **Let the SDK handle it automatically**
   <!-- Source: Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/connect/states#connection-states -->
   - Ably SDKs automatically reconnect after detecting a disconnection
   - Reconnection typically happens within 15 seconds
   - No manual intervention required for normal disconnections

2. **Design your app for resilience**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80003-knowledge.md lines 55-76 -->
   - Queue user actions during brief disconnections
   - Implement optimistic UI updates
   - Cache important data locally
   - Show subtle connection indicators only after a few seconds

3. **Monitor for excessive disconnections**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80003-knowledge.md lines 37-52 -->
   - Check network stability if disconnections happen multiple times per minute
   - Test on different networks (WiFi vs cellular)
   - Monitor patterns - specific times, locations, or activities

4. **For persistent issues**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80003-knowledge.md lines 101-109 -->
   - If disconnections never resolve automatically
   - If all users in a region experience frequent disconnections
   - Contact support with connection logs and patterns

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs handle 80003 errors automatically:
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80003-analysis.md line 169 -->
- Immediate detection of connection loss
- Exponential backoff retry strategy
- Automatic reconnection within 15 seconds
- Message queueing during disconnection (with default settings)
- State recovery after reconnection

## Prevention

While disconnections are normal and can't be eliminated entirely, you can minimize their impact:
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80003-knowledge.md lines 77-85 -->

- **Connection Monitoring**: Track patterns to identify unusual behavior
- **Network Optimization**: Use stable connections where possible
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design features to work during brief offline periods
- **User Experience**: Don't alarm users with error messages for brief disconnections

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Android
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80003-knowledge.md lines 126-132 -->
- Android 14+ may experience connection instability in background
- Consider closing connection when backgrounded with a delay
- Reconnect when returning to foreground

### Browser
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80003-knowledge.md lines 143-149 -->
- Browser performs connectivity check to `internet-up.ably-realtime.com`
- Shows "Unable to connect (network unreachable)" when offline
