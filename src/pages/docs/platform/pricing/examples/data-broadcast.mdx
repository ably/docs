title: Data broadcast pricing example
meta_description: "A pricing example that uses Ably Pub/Sub for data broadcast. Example shows how message conflation reduces message costs from ~$1,800 to ~$370/month for 10K users across 50 matches."
meta_keywords: "sports betting, live odds, realtime odds updates, message conflation, Pub/Sub pricing, betting platform, live sports data, odds streaming, realtime data delivery, Ably Pub/Sub pricing"
intro: "This Pub/Sub example demonstrates consumption-based pricing for a realtime data broadcast – a single source publishing frequent updates to many subscribers."

This example uses a sports betting scenario where odds are updated and fanned out to bettors. The same pattern applies to any broadcast where only the latest value matters, such as stock tickers, live scores, auction platforms and transport arrivals.

## Assumptions
- 10,000 monthly active users
- 50 live matches per month
- 200 concurrent viewers per match
- 2-hour match duration
- 60-minute average session duration
- 10 raw odds updates per second from data provider
- Message conflation enabled (500ms interval)

These assumptions generate 147.6M messages, 2.4M connection minutes, and 4.8M channel minutes.

<Aside data-type='note'>
Conflation intervals are configurable from 100ms to 500ms – lower intervals reduce latency; higher intervals reduce message volume and costs.

## Cost summary
The high-level cost breakdown for this scenario. Messages are billed for both inbound (published to Ably) and outbound (delivered to subscribers) – 147.6M messages = 3.6M inbound + 144M outbound.
| Item | Calculation | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Messages (with conflation) | 147.6M × $2.50/M | $369 |
| Connection minutes | 2.4M × $1.00/M | $2.40 |
| Channel minutes | 4.8M × $1.00/M | $4.80 |
| Package fee |  | [See plans](/pricing) |
| **Total** |  | **~$377/month** |

## Message breakdown
How the message total is calculated. Conflation reduces outbound delivery from 10 updates/sec to 2 updates/sec (500ms interval).
| Item | Calculation | Messages |
|------|-------------|------|
| Inbound (from data provider) | 10 updates/sec × 7,200 sec × 50 matches | 3.6M |
| Outbound (to viewers, with conflation) | 2 updates/sec × 7,200 sec × 200 viewers × 50 matches | 144M |
| **Total** |  | **147.6M** |


## Connection and channel minutes
How connection and channel minute costs are calculated.

| Metric | Calculation | Monthly | Cost |
|--------|-------------|---------|------|
| Connection minutes | 10K users × 4 sessions × 60 mins | 2.4M | $2.40 |
| Channel minutes | 40K sessions × 60 mins × 2 channels | 4.8M | $4.80 |


## Why conflation, not batching?

For live betting, message conflation is the right optimization because:

- Old odds are semantically stale — batching would group outdated prices together
- Users need the latest price, not a history of price changes
- Conflation reduces both inbound and outbound message costs

Use server-side batching instead when every message matters (e.g., chat, notifications).

<Aside data-type='note'>
Without conflation: 723.6M messages = ~$1,809 in message costs. Conflation saves ~80%.

## Further optimization: Delta compression

For richer payloads (full market depth, live statistics), delta compression can reduce bandwidth costs by sending only the difference between updates.

| Payload type | Full size | With delta | Bandwidth reduction |
|--------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Full market (10+ selections) | 8 KiB | ~2 KiB | 75% |
| Live stats + odds bundle | 15 KiB | ~4 KiB | 73% |
