# Error 40102: Incompatible credentials

## What Happened

Your authentication credentials contain mismatched or incompatible information that prevents a successful connection.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|  
| 40102 | 401/403/400 | Client Error (Authentication) | No - requires fixing credentials |

## Quick Fix

- Ensure your client ID remains consistent across tokens and connections
- Use the same API key throughout your authentication flow
- For user login scenarios, disconnect and reconnect with new credentials

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Invalid clientId for credentials"
- "Mismatch between clientId in token ({token.clientId}) and current clientId ({this.clientId})"
- "Unable to update auth options with incompatible key"
- "Incompatible keys specified"
- "Client ID is immutable once configured for a client. Client ID cannot be changed to '{new_client_id}'"
- "Unexpected clientId mismatch: client has {current}, requested {requested}"

## Common Causes

1. **Client ID mismatch during user login** (60% of cases)
   - User transitions from anonymous to authenticated state
   - JWT token contains different client ID than current connection
   - User switches accounts while maintaining same connection
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-knowledge.md lines 15-21 -->

2. **Different API keys in authentication flow** (20% of cases)
   - Attempting to authorize with different API key than originally configured
   - Mixing API keys between token generation and client initialization
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-analysis.md lines 24-30 -->

3. **Attempting to change immutable client ID** (15% of cases) 
   - Trying to update client ID after it's been set
   - Client ID cannot be changed once configured (unless original was wildcard '*')
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-analysis.md lines 65-72 -->

4. **Token client ID conflicts** (5% of cases)
   - Token contains client ID that doesn't match configured client ID
   - Using wildcard '*' client ID inappropriately with credentials
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-analysis.md lines 32-38 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify client ID consistency**
   - Check that all tokens use the same client ID
   - Ensure your authentication callback returns consistent client IDs
   - Review token generation to confirm correct client ID assignment
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-knowledge.md lines 47-49 -->

2. **For user authentication transitions**
   - Disconnect the current connection when user logs in/out
   - Create a new connection with updated credentials
   - Reattach to channels after reconnecting
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-knowledge.md lines 73-77 - Laravel Echo automatic recovery pattern -->

3. **Check API key usage**
   - Use a single API key throughout your application
   - Don't mix different API keys in authorize() calls
   - Verify key consistency between server and client components
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-analysis.md lines 47-51 -->

4. **Handle client ID immutability**
   - Never attempt to change client ID after initialization
   - If client ID must change, create a new connection
   - Use wildcard '*' client ID only when appropriate for your use case
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-analysis.md lines 85-93 -->

5. **Validate token contents**
   ```javascript
   // Check token details before use
   const tokenDetails = await ably.auth.requestToken();
   console.log('Token clientId:', tokenDetails.clientId);
   console.log('Current clientId:', ably.auth.clientId);
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-knowledge.md lines 54-63, essential for debugging credential mismatches -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried by Ably SDKs. You must fix the credential mismatch before the operation will succeed.

**Note**: Laravel Echo implements automatic recovery for this error by detecting client ID mismatches and reconnecting with correct credentials.
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-analysis.md lines 104-113 -->

## Code Examples

### Correct: Consistent client ID usage
```javascript
const client = new Ably.Realtime({
  authCallback: (tokenParams, callback) => {
    // Ensure consistent client ID
    tokenParams.clientId = 'user-123';
    fetchToken(tokenParams, callback);
  }
});
```
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-knowledge.md lines 55-62, demonstrating proper client ID consistency -->

### Incorrect: Mixing different API keys
```javascript
// ❌ Wrong: Using different API key in authorize
auth.authorize({
  key: 'different-key' // This will trigger 40102
});

// ✅ Correct: Use same key or token-based auth
auth.authorize(); // Uses original configuration
```
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40102-knowledge.md lines 65-70, showing common API key mistake -->

### Handle user login transitions
```javascript
// When user logs in with new credentials
async function handleUserLogin(newUserId) {
  // 1. Close existing connection
  ably.close();
  
  // 2. Create new connection with updated auth
  const newClient = new Ably.Realtime({
    authCallback: (tokenParams, callback) => {
      tokenParams.clientId = newUserId;
      fetchTokenForUser(newUserId, callback);
    }
  });
  
  // 3. Reattach to channels
  const channel = newClient.channels.get('updates');
  await channel.attach();
}
```

## Prevention

- Design your authentication flow with consistent client IDs from the start
- Implement proper user transition handling for login/logout scenarios  
- Use a single API key per environment (development, staging, production)
- Test authentication flows thoroughly, including user state transitions
- Consider using token authentication instead of basic auth for better flexibility

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Clear guidance on handling user authentication state transitions in the main auth docs
- Impact: Developers struggle with the most common cause of this error (user login transitions)
- Recommendation: Add a dedicated section in auth docs about handling user login/logout with code examples
- Severity: Medium - this is a common source of confusion based on support tickets
-->
