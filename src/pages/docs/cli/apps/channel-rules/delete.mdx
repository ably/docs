```
</Code>

Use the `ably apps channel-rules delete` command to permanently remove a [channel rule](/docs/channels/channel-rules-namespaces) from an Ably app. This action cannot be undone and will remove all configured behaviors for channels matching the rule pattern.

## Arguments

### `<NAMEORID>` <a id="nameorid"/>

The name or ID of the channel rule to delete, for example: `chat` or `/gfgdchvj`.

## Flags

In addition to the [global flags](/docs/cli#global-flags), the `ably apps channel-rules delete` command supports:

### `--app` <a id="app"/>

App ID or name to delete the channel rule from. If not specified, uses the current app from your CLI configuration.

### `--force | -f` <a id="force"/>

Force deletion without confirmation prompt. Use with caution as this action is irreversible.
