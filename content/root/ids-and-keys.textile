Ably uses IDs to specify which account or app an operation should affect, and API keys to authenticate these operations.

This page covers how to find your:

* "Account ID":#account-id
* "App ID":#app-id
* "API Key":#api-key

h2(#account-id). Account ID

Account IDs are used by operations that affect your entire account, such as listing the apps associated with a particular account. 

h3(#find-account-id). How to find your account ID

In the "Ably dashboard":https://ably.com/accounts/any click the dropdown from the top right, then select 'Account settings':

<a href="/images/screenshots/ids-keys/account-settings.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/ids-keys/account-settings.png" style="width: 70%" alt="Account settings">
</a>

Note, if you have more than one account, you can change accounts from the top left dropdown.

Your account settings are displayed and you can now find your account ID on this page:

</a>

h2(#app-id). App ID

App IDs are used by operations that affect individual apps, such as creating an API key.

h3(#find-app-id). How to find your app ID

In the "Ably dashboard":https://ably.com/accounts/any select the app you want to find the app ID for. Click on the 'Settings' tab:

<a href="/images/screenshots/ids-keys/app-settings.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/ids-keys/app-settings.png" style="width: 70%" alt="App settings">
</a>

The "App ID" is displayed under 'Application settings':

</a>

h2(#api-key). API key

Ably uses API keys for authentication, either directly ("basic authentication":/auth/basic) or for generating tokens ("token authentication":/auth/token). Each application has at least one API key and each key can have different capabilities specified.

API keys contain three parts: the public app ID and public app key ID (which, combined, form the API key ID) and the API key secret. An example API key is: @I2E_JQ.OqUdfg:EVKVTCBlzLBPYJiCZTsIW_pqylJ9WVRB5K9P19Ap1y0@, made up of:

* @I2E_JQ.OqUdfg@ is the public API key ID (made from the public app ID and app key ID)
** @I2E_JQ@ is the public app ID (the part before the first period)
** @OqUdfg@ is the public app key ID (after the period and before the colon)
* @EVKVTCBlzLBPYJiCZTsIW_pqylJ9WVRB5K9P19Ap1y0@ is the API secret key (after the colon)

API keys should be kept secret. 

h3(#find-api-key). How to find your API Key

In the "Ably dashboard":https://ably.com/accounts/any select the app you want to find the API keys for. Click on the "API Keys" tab:

<a href="/images/screenshots/ids-keys/api-keys.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/ids-keys/api-keys.png" style="width: 70%" alt="API keys">
</a>

Your API keys are then individually displayed with only the public key segment showing, click 'show' to reveal your API secret key:
