It is worth noting Fanout’s paid accounts are $25 *plus* usage costs. You pay for extra minutes and/ or connections during peak moments. You also pay extra if you exceed your messaging limits.

Fanout operate a usage-based pricing scheme but charge customers based on the connected client time rather than peak connections. If clients are connected with idle connections for long periods of time then costs can quickly add up.
