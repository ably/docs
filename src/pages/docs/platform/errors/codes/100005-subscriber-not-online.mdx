# Error 100005: Subscriber not online

## What happened

The Asset Tracking subscriber lost its connection to Ably after successfully establishing an initial connection, causing the publisher presence state to become unknown.

## Quick reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 100005 | N/A | Connection/Presence (Asset Tracking) | Yes - automatic reconnection |

## Quick fix

- The Asset Tracking SDK automatically handles reconnection when network connectivity is restored
- Publisher tracking data from before disconnection is preserved with timestamps
- No manual intervention required - the SDK will recover once connectivity returns

## Error messages

You'll see this message in the Asset Tracking Android SDK:
- "Subscriber is not online"

## Common causes

1. **Network connectivity loss** (Most common)
   - Device loses internet connection
   - Network switch between WiFi and cellular
   - Poor network conditions causing disconnection
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100005-analysis.md lines 127-135 -->

2. **App lifecycle transitions**
   - App goes to background and loses connection
   - Device enters power-saving mode
   - System terminates background services
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100005-analysis.md lines 132-133 -->

3. **Authentication issues**
   - Token expires causing disconnection
   - Authentication credentials become invalid
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100005-analysis.md line 134 -->

## Resolution steps

1. **Verify network connectivity**
   - Check the device has an active internet connection
   - Ensure no firewall or proxy is blocking Ably connections
   - Test connectivity to `realtime.ably.io`
   <!-- Source: Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection section "Connection management" -->

2. **Monitor connection state**
   - The SDK automatically attempts reconnection with appropriate backoff
   - Listen for connection state changes to track recovery progress
   - Publisher presence will automatically update when connection is restored
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100005-analysis.md lines 92-94 -->

3. **Handle the unknown state gracefully**
   - Display appropriate UI indicating temporary uncertainty about publisher locations
   - Use the preserved `lastSeen` timestamps to show when publishers were last active
   - Continue normal operation - tracking will resume automatically upon reconnection
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100005-analysis.md lines 47-50 -->

## Automatic handling

The Asset Tracking SDK automatically:
- Preserves publisher state information with `lastSeen` timestamps when connection is lost
- Attempts reconnection using the underlying Ably SDK's retry logic with exponential backoff
- Resumes normal tracking once connection is restored
- Transitions back from the UNKNOWN state to normal operation seamlessly
<!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/100005-analysis.md lines 88-94 -->

## Prevention

- Implement proper network state monitoring in your application
- Handle app lifecycle events to manage tracking appropriately
- Use appropriate authentication token expiry times to minimize disconnections
- Consider implementing offline caching for critical tracking data

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Detailed Asset Tracking presence state machine documentation
- Impact: Developers may not understand the UNKNOWN state behavior
- Recommendation: Add comprehensive state diagram to Asset Tracking docs showing online → offline → unknown transitions
- Severity: Low (error is handled automatically, but understanding would help)
-->
