A @Stats@ object represents a application statistic for the specified interval and time period. Ably aggregates statistics globally for all accounts and applications, and makes these available both through our "statistics API":/realtime/statistics as well as your "application dashboard":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000030053-how-do-i-access-my-app-dashboard.

Please note that most attributes of the @Stats@ type below contain references to further stats types. This documentation is not exhaustive for all stats types, and as such, links to the stats types below will take you to the "Ruby library stats documentation":http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ably/Ably/Models/Stats which contains exhaustive stats documentation. Ruby and Python however uses @under_score@ case instead of the default @camelCase@ in most languages, so please bear that in mind.
