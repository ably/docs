The Pubnub protocol adapter allows you to interact with Ably using the Pubnub protocol. You can use this to gradually migrate across from Pubnub to Ably. Rather than having to rewrite all your apps to use Ably client libraries at once, you can use the protocol adapter, then migrate across to Ably client libraries one by one at your leisure, to take advantage of "Ably features not supported by the Pubnub client libraries":https://www.ably.io/compare/ably-vs-pubnub, such as "the ability to use websockets":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000044831-which-transports-are-supported%2D (Pubnub client libraries support "long-polling":/concepts/long-polling only). Alternatively, you can use a Pubnub client library on some platform for which no native Ably client library is available yet, such as Arduino.

Full usage notes for the adapter are available at: "Using the Ably Pubnub Protocol Adapter":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000055107-using-the-ably-pubnub-protocol-adaptor.

This tutorial assumes that you already have Pubnub client libraries set up with Pubnub, and just want to convert it to use Ably.

  default: Step 2 - Point your client libraries to Ably

blang[javascript,nodejs].
  You'll need to modify the client library initializer by replacing both the publish and subscribe key with your Ably API key. You'll also need to add some things to the options object, as follows:

  ```[javascript]
    var apiKey = "<your Ably API key>";
    var pubnub = PUBNUB({
      publish_key        : apiKey,
      subscribe_key      : apiKey,
      origin             : 'pubnub.ably.io',
      ssl                : true,
      no_wait_for_pending: true
    });
  ```
  (In addition to whatever options you would normally use).

  You'll need to modify the client library initializer by replacing both the publish and subscribe key with your Ably API key. You'll also need to add some things to the options object, as follows:

  ```[ruby]
  api_key = "<your Ably API key>"
  pubnub = Pubnub.new(
    :subscribe_key => api_key,
    :publish_key   => api_key,
    :origin        => 'pubnub.ably.io',
    :ssl           => true
  )
  ```

Don't try to use different Ably API keys for the @publish_key@ and @subscribe_key@. Unlike Pubnub, Ably does not use different keys for publish and subscribe; instead, capabilities are connection-oriented, and the Adapter will use whatever you pass as the @subscribe_key@ to create the Ably connection. If that key does not have publish capabilities, you will not be able to publish, whatever the @publish_key@ has.

If we don't have an example in the language you'll be using, check the "Pubnub documentation for that library":https://pubnub.com/docs to find the equivalent options to the ones in the Javascript example (for realtime libraries) or the Ruby or Node.js example (for REST libraries) above.

h2.
  default: Step 3 - check you're not using any unsupported features

The Pubnub adapter does not yet support PAM, wherenow, channel groups, backfill subscribes, or stream filters. If you use any of these, "let us know":https://www.ably.io/contact and we can advise on Ably-supported ways to achieve the same goal. (For example, instead of PAM we have our "token authentication system":https://www.ably.io/documentation/core-features/authentication).

Also note that since the adapter has to translate every Pubnub operation to the equivalent Ably operation, some Pubnub operations can be quite expensive, in terms of the time it takes to do them and the number of API requests they count against your package quota. For example, if you do a 'global herenow' request (which returns every presence member in every active channel in your app), behind the scenes the adapter will do a request for a list of active channels, followed by a presence request for each of those channels, for a total of n+1 requests for n active channels.

h2.
  default: Step 4 - interoperability between Pubnub and Ably client libraries

Behind the scenes, the adapter uses the normal Ably service, so you can use Pubnub and Ably client libraries side by side, and they'll interoperate. For example, here's some code that subscribes to the same channel from both Pubnub and Ably client libraries, then publishes using both.

blang[javascript,nodejs].
  ```[javascript]
    var channelName = 'some_channel';

    /* Subscribe to the 'some_channel' channel with the Ably client */
    var ablyChannel = ably.channels.get(channelName);
    ablyChannel.subscribe(function(message) {
      log('Ably client received a message: ' + JSON.stringify(message.data));
    });

    /* Subscribe to the 'some_channel' channel with the Pubnub client */
    pubnub.subscribe({
      channel : channelName,
      message : function(message) {
        log('Pubnub client received a message: ' + JSON.stringify(message));
      }
    });

    /* Publish a message with the Ably client
     * Note that we use null as the message name, since any message
     * name will be ignored by the Pubnub client */
    ablyChannel.publish(null, { 'Some': 'JSON data sent by the Ably client library' });

    /* Publish a message with the Pubnub client */
    pubnub.publish({
      channel : channelName,
      message : { 'Some': 'JSON data sent by the Pubnub client library' }
    });
  ```

    end

      channel: channel_name,
    ) do |env|

    end

    # message name will be ignored by the Pubnub client
    ablyChannel.publish(nil, { some: 'data sent by the Ably client library' })

    # Publish a message with the Pubnub client
    pubnub.publish(
      channel: channel_name,
      message: { some: 'data sent by the Pubnub client library' }
    ) {}
  ```

There are a few things to be aware of:

h4. Publishing and subscribing

* Pubnub does not have a concept of a message name. So A publish using the Pubnub adapter will leave the Ably message name blank, and message name is not visible to Pubnub adapter subscribers. Pubnub message content is mapped to Ably message data (the payload).
* Commas are valid in Ably channel names, but Pubnub uses commas as delimiters. So Ably channels with commas in them will not be accessible to Pubnub clients.

h4. Presence and state

* Pubnub's @UUID@ is mapped to Ably's "@clientId@":https://www.ably.io/documentation/realtime/authentication#identified-clients.
* Pubnub considers the same @UUID@ to be the same (in terms of membership of the presence set); Ably considers the same @clientid@ on different connections to be different. (If using the adapter to get the state for a @clientId@, if there are multiple members in the set with the same @clientId@, the adapter will just pick one).
* Pubnub's member state is mapped to Ably's presence data. With presence data, member aren't permitted to change other members' presence data. So each client can only set its own state, not other people's.

h4. Connections

* In Pubnub's model, message continuity is available for '5-20 minutes' and up to 100 messages. To provide compatibility with this, the Pubnub adapter will stay connected and attached to your channels for 5 minutes after the last subscribe long poll it receives. After 5 minutes, the adapter will disconnect from Ably, and any subsequent subscribe poll will be treated as a new connection (and will get messages from that point in time onwards).
* During development, using a lot of different uuids (eg using the @unique_uuid@ option of the Pubnub js lib to generate a new uuid on each page refresh) may result in connections racking up quickly, as each will stay alive for at least 5 minutes. We recommend avoiding that option, at least during development.
