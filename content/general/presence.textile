Presence allows you to know the connection status of a client or a device. Apart from letting you know who is online/offline at a particular point in time, you also subscribe to presence updates( Note: This is only available with Ably's Realtime Library). This means that Ably will automatically notify all it's presence subscribers whenever a client on that very presence channel has left or a new client has joined.
