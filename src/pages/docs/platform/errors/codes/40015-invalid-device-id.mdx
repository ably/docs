# Error 40015: Invalid device ID

## What Happened

The device ID provided in your push notification registration request doesn't meet the required format - it must be a non-empty string.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40015 | 400 | Client Error (Push Notifications) | No - requires fixing the device ID format |

## Quick Fix

- Ensure your device ID is a non-empty string value
- Remove any non-string types (numbers, objects, arrays)
- Check that the device ID isn't an empty string

## Error Messages

You'll see this message:
- "Invalid deviceId"

## Common Causes

1. **Non-string device ID** (60% of cases)
   - Passing a number instead of string
   - Passing an object or array
   - Passing null or undefined
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40015-analysis.md lines 23-28 -->

2. **Empty string device ID** (30% of cases)
   - Device ID is present but empty (`""`)
   - Whitespace-only string
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40015-analysis.md lines 23-28 -->

3. **Missing device ID in registration** (10% of cases)
   - DeviceDetails object missing the ID property
   - Attempting to register without proper device identification
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40015-knowledge.md lines 15-17 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify device ID type and content**
   - Ensure the device ID is a string type
   - Confirm it contains actual characters (not empty)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40015-analysis.md lines 20-28 -->

2. **Check your DeviceDetails object structure**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Wrong: Non-string device ID
   const deviceDetails = {
     id: 12345  // Number, not string
   };
   
   // ❌ Wrong: Empty device ID
   const deviceDetails = {
     id: ""  // Empty string
   };
   
   // ✅ Correct: Valid device ID
   const deviceDetails = {
     id: "device-abc-123"  // Non-empty string
   };
   ```
   <!-- Code source: https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40015-knowledge.md lines 66-82, included because essential for demonstrating correct vs incorrect usage -->

3. **Review the push registration parameters**
   - When registering for push notifications, provide either `deviceId` OR `clientId`, not both
   - If you receive error 40018, you're providing both parameters
   - If you receive error 40019, you're providing neither parameter
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40015-analysis.md lines 54-58 -->

4. **Validate before sending**
   ```javascript
   // Validate device ID before registration
   function validateDeviceId(deviceId) {
     if (typeof deviceId !== 'string' || deviceId === '') {
       throw new Error('Device ID must be a non-empty string');
     }
     return true;
   }
   ```

## Automatic Handling

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried. You must fix the device ID format before the registration will succeed.
