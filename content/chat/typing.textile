Signal when a user is typing to indicate to other participants that a message is being written.

h2(#implementation). Implementation

Use the "presence":/presence-occupancy/presence feature to implement a typing indicator.

h3(#enter). Enter

The @enter@ event is intentionally initiated by the client on behalf of the chat participant, allowing them to signify actions such as marking themselves as online upon logging into the platform. For instance, when dealing with a chat participant represented by a user object featuring a @status@ field, the @enter@ event can be triggered using the provided code snippet below. This code serves the purpose of setting the status of the chat participant to @online@, indicating their entry to the channel.

```[javascript]
    // Enter the chat participant into the presence set
    channel.presence.enter((err) => {
      // Custom functionality to update UI for chat participant that they are now online.
    });
```

h3(#update). Update

The chat participant status can be used as the indicator of whether they're currently typing or not, allowing other chat participants to see a visual cue. The status field is a text based field, so the value can be whichever text value of your choosing.

```[javascript]
    // Subscribe to any presence updates for the current presence set
    channel.presence.subscribe('update', (memberUpdate) => {
      // Update current array of users typing to display the one for memberUpdate as typing.
    });
```

Depending on the UI, it is recommended to display a limited number of the names of chat participants typing. If that number is exceeded, it's common practice to instead change the visual indicator to a string such as "People are typingâ€¦".

h3(#example). Demo example

Below is an example of each part required for the typing indicator to be implemented. Once the client has an authToken with a clientId associated with it, you join the predefined channel and enter the presence set for that channel.

The application needs to subscribe to any updates of that presence set and would then update the visual cues displaying which chat participants are currently typing.

For the chat participant, an event listener waits for a keypress before publishing an update to the presence set, updating this chat participant's status with a string indicating they're typing. A timer is set to expire in five seconds to reset this status if there has been no further keys pressed in that time.

```[javascript]
    let isTyping = false;
    let typingInterval;
    let usersTyping = [];

    var client = new Ably.Realtime(authToken);
    var channel = client.channels.get('CHANNEL_NAME');

    // Subscribe to any presence updates for the current presence set
    channel.presence.subscribe('update', (memberUpdate) => {
      // find your user by their client id
      user = '';
      // Adding user to array of users typing
      usersTyping.push(user);
    });

    // Enter the chat participant into the presence set
    channel.presence.enter((err) => {
      // Custom functionality to update UI for chat participants that they are now online.
    });

    // Listener for when chat participant presses a key on their keyboard
    document.addEventListener('keypress', (event) => {
      publishTyping(channel)
    }, false);

    // The chat participant has pressed a key, publish to the presence channel
    // that they are, and initiate a timer to reset the typing indicator if no
    // further key presses are made within 5 seconds
    function publishTyping(channel) {
      if (isTyping === false) {
        channel.presence.update('is typing', (err) => {
          isTyping = true;

          typingInterval = setInterval(stopTyping(channel), 5000);
        });
      } else {
        clearInterval(typingInterval);
        typingInterval = setInterval(stopTyping(channel), 5000);
      }
    }

    // The timer has reached the end, the chat participant hasn't pressed a key in the time
    // frame, so publish that they've stopped and remove them from the local usersTyping array.
    function stopTyping(channel) {
      channel.presence.update('has stopped typing', (err) => {
        const index = usersTyping.findIndex((userEntry) => {
          return userEntry.clientId === user.clientId;
        })

        usersTyping.splice(index, 1);
        isTyping = false
      });
    }
```
