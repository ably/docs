# Error 92000: LiveObjects validation error

## What Happened

A LiveObjects operation failed validation due to invalid data, missing state, or synchronization issues in Ably's distributed data structures.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 92000 | 500 | Server Error (LiveObjects) | No - requires fixing validation issue |

## Quick Fix

- Validate object IDs match expected format before operations
- Ensure LiveObjects are synchronized before attempting updates
- Implement proper error recovery with state resynchronization
- Check for race conditions in concurrent operations

## Error Messages

You may encounter one of these variations:
- "Invalid serial: {serial}" - Operation serial number is invalid
- "Invalid site code: {siteCode}" - Site identifier validation failed
- "Missing object state; LiveCounter objectId={id}" - LiveCounter state not found
- "Missing object state; LiveMap objectId={id}" - LiveMap state not found
- "Invalid object id string" - Object ID format is incorrect

## Common Causes

1. **Invalid Object ID Format** (40% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-analysis.md lines 44-50 -->
   - Malformed object ID string
   - Invalid characters in ID
   - Attempting to parse corrupted or truncated IDs
   - Using client-generated IDs that don't match system format

2. **Missing Object State** (30% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-analysis.md lines 29-42 -->
   - Object not yet synchronized after connection
   - State lost during network disconnection
   - Operations on objects that haven't been created
   - Race condition where object deleted before operation

3. **Invalid Operation Sequencing** (20% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-analysis.md lines 13-27 -->
   - Serial numbers out of sequence
   - Invalid or unrecognized site code
   - Operations arriving out of order
   - Conflicting concurrent operations

4. **Network and Synchronization Issues** (10% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 36-42 -->
   - Network partitions causing state divergence
   - Timing-dependent race conditions
   - State corruption during sync
   - Incomplete initial synchronization

## Resolution Steps

1. **Validate Object IDs Before Operations**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 57-63 -->
   - Check ID format matches expected pattern
   - Ensure ID hasn't been truncated or corrupted
   - Verify ID exists in your application's context
   - Use try-catch blocks around ID parsing operations

2. **Ensure Object Existence and Synchronization**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 26-30 -->
   - Wait for initial LiveObjects synchronization to complete
   - Verify the object exists before performing updates
   - Check connection state before operations
   - Handle missing state errors gracefully

3. **Implement Comprehensive Error Recovery**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 77-82 -->
   ```javascript
   try {
     await liveObject.update(operation);
   } catch (err) {
     if (err.code === 92000) {
       // Clear local state
       await clearLocalState();
       // Fetch fresh state from server
       await resynchronize();
       // Retry operation
       await liveObject.update(operation);
     }
   }
   ```
   <!-- Code source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 66-75, essential for demonstrating error recovery pattern -->

4. **Handle Operation Ordering Issues**
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-analysis.md lines 63-67 -->
   - Ensure operations have valid serial numbers
   - Verify site codes match expected values
   - Implement idempotent operations where possible
   - Use proper concurrency controls

## Automatic Handling

LiveObjects validation errors require manual intervention. The SDK cannot automatically resolve these issues as they indicate:
- Data integrity problems that need correction
- State synchronization issues requiring resync
- Invalid operations that must be fixed at the source

## Code Examples

### Proper Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
// Validate before operations
function isValidObjectId(id) {
  // Check format based on your ID pattern
  return id && typeof id === 'string' && id.length > 0;
}

// Handle validation errors
async function updateLiveObject(liveObject, operation) {
  if (!isValidObjectId(liveObject.id)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid object ID format');
  }
  
  try {
    await liveObject.update(operation);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === 92000) {
      console.error('LiveObjects validation error:', error.message);
      // Implement recovery strategy
      await recoverFromValidationError(liveObject);
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Prevention

- **Input Validation**: Always validate object IDs and operation data before submission
  <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 84-85 -->
- **State Recovery**: Implement robust state recovery after connection loss
  <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md line 86 -->
- **Idempotent Design**: Make operations safely retryable
  <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md line 87 -->
- **Error Monitoring**: Track validation errors to identify patterns
  <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md line 88 -->
- **Synchronization Checks**: Verify sync completion before operations
  <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md line 89 -->
