Non-enveloped events have quite a few headers, in order to provide context to the data sent in the payload. These are:

- content-type := the type of the payload. This can be either @application/json@, @text/plain@, or @application/octet-stream@, depending on if it's @JSON@, @text@, or @binary@ respectively
- x-ably-version := the version of the Webhook. At present this should be @1.2@
- x-ably-envelope-appid := the "app ID":/docs/ids-and-keys/ which the message came from
- x-ably-envelope-channel := the Ably channel which the message came from
- x-ably-envelope-rule-id := the Ably rule ID which was activated to send this message
- x-ably-envelope-site := the Ably datacenter which sent the message
- x-ably-envelope-source := the "source":#sources for the webhook, which will be one of @channel.message@, @channel.presence@, @channel.lifecycle@, or @channel.occupancy@
- x-ably-message-client-id := the client ID of the connection which sent the event
- x-ably-message-connection-id := the connection ID responsible for the initial event
- x-ably-message-id := the message's unique ID
- x-ably-message-timestamp := the time the message was originally sent
