This guide shows you how to stream AI responses from [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview) over Ably using the [message-per-response pattern](/docs/ai-transport/token-streaming/message-per-response). Specifically, it appends each response token to a single Ably message, creating a complete AI response that grows incrementally while delivering tokens in realtime.

Using Ably to distribute tokens from LangGraph enables you to broadcast AI responses to thousands of concurrent subscribers with reliable message delivery and ordering guarantees. This approach stores each complete response as a single message in channel history, making it easy to retrieve conversation history without processing thousands of individual token messages.

</Aside>

## Prerequisites <a id="prerequisites"/>

To follow this guide, you need:
- Node.js 20 or higher
- An Anthropic API key
- An Ably API key

Useful links:
- [LangGraph documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)
- [Ably JavaScript SDK getting started](/docs/getting-started/javascript)

Create a new NPM package, which will contain the publisher and subscriber code:

<Code>
```shell
mkdir ably-langgraph-example-per-response && cd ably-langgraph-example-per-response
npm init -y
```
</Code>

Install the required packages using NPM:

<Code>
```shell
npm install @langchain/langgraph@^0.2 @langchain/anthropic@^0.3 @langchain/core@^0.3 ably@^2
```
</Code>

<Aside data-type="note">
This guide uses LangGraph with the Anthropic provider and Claude Sonnet 4.5 model. LangGraph supports [multiple model providers](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) including OpenAI, Google, and others. The streaming approach shown in this guide works with any LangChain-compatible model.
</Aside>

Export your Anthropic API key to the environment, which will be used later in the guide by the Anthropic SDK:

<Code>
```shell
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
</Code>

## Step 1: Enable message appends <a id="step-1"/>

Message append functionality requires "Message annotations, updates, deletes and appends" to be enabled in a [channel rule](/docs/channels#rules) associated with the channel.

<Aside data-type="important">
When the "Message annotations, updates, deletes and appends" channel rule is enabled, messages are persisted irrespective of whether or not persistence has also been explicitly enabled. This increases usage since [we charge for persisting messages](https://faqs.ably.com/how-does-ably-count-messages).
</Aside>

To enable the channel rule:

1. Go to the [Ably dashboard](https://www.ably.com/dashboard) and select your app.
2. Navigate to the "Configuration" > "Rules" section from the left-hand navigation bar.
3. Choose "Add new rule".
4. Enter a channel name or namespace pattern (e.g. `ai` for all channels starting with `ai:`).
5. Select the "Message annotations, updates, deletes and appends" option from the list.
6. Click "Create channel rule".

The examples in this guide use the `ai:` namespace prefix, which assumes you have configured the rule for `ai:*`.

<Aside data-type="note">
The `ai:` namespace is just a naming convention used in this guide. There's nothing special about it - you can use any namespace pattern you like, as long as your channel name matches the configured channel rule.
</Aside>

## Step 2: Get a streamed response from LangGraph <a id="step-2"/>

Initialize LangGraph with a simple graph that uses Claude to respond to prompts, and use [`stream`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/streaming) with `streamMode: "messages"` to stream model tokens.

Create a new file `publisher.mjs` with the following contents:

<Code>
```javascript
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";
import { StateGraph, Annotation, START, END } from "@langchain/langgraph";

// Initialize the model
const model = new ChatAnthropic({ model: "claude-sonnet-4-5" });

// Define state with message history
const StateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
  messages: Annotation({
    reducer: (x, y) => x.concat(y),
    default: () => [],
  }),
});

// Build and compile a simple graph
const graph = new StateGraph(StateAnnotation)
  .addNode("agent", async (state) => {
    const response = await model.invoke(state.messages);
    return { messages: [response] };
  })
  .addEdge(START, "agent")
  .addEdge("agent", END);

const app = graph.compile();

// Stream response tokens
async function streamLangGraphResponse(prompt) {
  const stream = await app.stream(
    { messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }] },
    { streamMode: "messages" }
  );

  for await (const [messageChunk, metadata] of stream) {
    console.log(messageChunk.content || "(empty)");
  }
}

// Usage example
streamLangGraphResponse("Tell me a short joke");
```
</Code>

### Understand LangGraph streaming <a id="understand-streaming"/>

LangGraph's [`stream`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/streaming) method with `streamMode: "messages"` streams LLM tokens from your graph. The stream returns tuples of `[messageChunk, metadata]` where:

- `messageChunk`: Contains the token content in the `content` field. These represent incremental text chunks as the model generates them. The message chunk also includes an `id` field that uniquely identifies the response.

- `metadata`: Contains metadata about the stream, including the `langgraph_node` where the LLM is invoked and any associated tags.

The following example shows the message chunks received when streaming a response. Each event is a tuple of `[messageChunk, metadata]`:

<Code>
```json
// 1. Stream initialization (empty content with model metadata)
[{"lc":1,"type":"constructor","id":["langchain_core","messages","AIMessageChunk"],"kwargs":{"content":"","additional_kwargs":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_01SPbpi5P7CkNqgxPT2Ne9u5","type":"message","role":"assistant"},"tool_call_chunks":[],"usage_metadata":{"input_tokens":12,"output_tokens":1,"total_tokens":13},"id":"msg_01SPbpi5P7CkNqgxPT2Ne9u5"}},{"langgraph_step":1,"langgraph_node":"agent","langgraph_triggers":["branch:to:agent"]}]

// 2. Empty content chunk
[{"lc":1,"type":"constructor","id":["langchain_core","messages","AIMessageChunk"],"kwargs":{"content":"","additional_kwargs":{},"tool_call_chunks":[],"id":"msg_01SPbpi5P7CkNqgxPT2Ne9u5"}},{"langgraph_step":1,"langgraph_node":"agent"}]

// 3. Text tokens stream in
[{"lc":1,"type":"constructor","id":["langchain_core","messages","AIMessageChunk"],"kwargs":{"content":"Why","additional_kwargs":{},"tool_call_chunks":[],"id":"msg_01SPbpi5P7CkNqgxPT2Ne9u5"}},{"langgraph_step":1,"langgraph_node":"agent"}]
[{"lc":1,"type":"constructor","id":["langchain_core","messages","AIMessageChunk"],"kwargs":{"content":" don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause","additional_kwargs":{},"tool_call_chunks":[],"id":"msg_01SPbpi5P7CkNqgxPT2Ne9u5"}},{"langgraph_step":1,"langgraph_node":"agent"}]
[{"lc":1,"type":"constructor","id":["langchain_core","messages","AIMessageChunk"],"kwargs":{"content":" they make up everything!","additional_kwargs":{},"tool_call_chunks":[],"id":"msg_01SPbpi5P7CkNqgxPT2Ne9u5"}},{"langgraph_step":1,"langgraph_node":"agent"}]

// 4. Stream completion (empty content with stop reason and final usage)
[{"lc":1,"type":"constructor","id":["langchain_core","messages","AIMessageChunk"],"kwargs":{"content":"","additional_kwargs":{"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null},"usage_metadata":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":17,"total_tokens":17},"id":"msg_01SPbpi5P7CkNqgxPT2Ne9u5"}},{"langgraph_step":1,"langgraph_node":"agent"}]
```
</Code>

<Aside data-type="note">
This is only an illustrative example for a simple "text in, text out" use case and may not reflect the exact sequence of messages that you observe from LangGraph. LangGraph also supports more complex graphs with multiple nodes, tools, and conditional edges. For complete details on streaming modes, see [LangGraph streaming documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/streaming).
</Aside>

## Step 3: Publish streaming tokens to Ably <a id="step-3"/>

Publish LangGraph streaming tokens to Ably using message appends to reliably and scalably distribute them to subscribers.

Each AI response is stored as a single Ably message that grows as tokens are appended.

### Initialize the Ably client <a id="initialize-ably"/>

Add the Ably client initialization to your `publisher.mjs` file:

<Code>
```javascript
import Ably from 'ably';

// Initialize Ably Realtime client
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({
  key: '{{API_KEY}}',
  echoMessages: false
});

// Create a channel for publishing streamed AI responses
const channel = realtime.channels.get('ai:{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
```
</Code>

The Ably Realtime client maintains a persistent connection to the Ably service, which allows you to publish tokens at high message rates with low latency.

<Aside data-type="note">
Set [`echoMessages`](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#client-options) to `false` on the agent's Ably client to prevent the agent from receiving its own streamed tokens, avoiding billing for [echoed messages](/docs/pub-sub/advanced#echo).
</Aside>

### Publish initial message and append tokens <a id="publish-and-append"/>

When a new response begins, publish an initial message to create it. Ably assigns a [`serial`](/docs/messages#properties) identifier to the message. Use this `serial` to append each token to the message as it arrives from the LangGraph stream.

Update your `publisher.mjs` file to publish the initial message and append tokens:

<Code>
```javascript
// Track state across chunks
let msgSerial = null;

// Stream response tokens
async function streamLangGraphResponse(prompt) {
  const stream = await app.stream(
    { messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }] },
    { streamMode: "messages" }
  );

  for await (const [messageChunk, metadata] of stream) {
    const content = messageChunk?.content;

    // Publish initial empty message on first chunk
    if (!msgSerial && messageChunk?.id) {
      const result = await channel.publish({
        name: 'response',
        data: ''
      });

      // Capture the message serial for appending tokens
      msgSerial = result.serials[0];
    }

    // Append token content to the message
    if (content && msgSerial) {
      channel.appendMessage({
        serial: msgSerial,
        data: content
      });
    }
  }

  console.log('Stream completed!');
}
```
</Code>

This implementation:

- Publishes an initial empty message when the first chunk arrives and captures the `serial`
- Filters for chunks with non-empty `content`
- Appends each token to the original message using the captured `serial`

<Aside data-type="note">
Append operations are published without `await` to maximize throughput. Ably maintains message ordering even without awaiting each append. For more information, see [Publishing tokens](/docs/ai-transport/token-streaming/message-per-response#publishing).
</Aside>

<Aside data-type="important">
Standard Ably message [size limits](/docs/platform/pricing/limits#message) apply to the complete concatenated message. If appending a token would exceed the maximum message size, the append is rejected.
</Aside>

Run the publisher to see tokens streaming to Ably:

<Code>
```shell
node publisher.mjs
```
</Code>

## Step 4: Subscribe to streaming tokens <a id="step-4"/>

Create a subscriber that receives the streaming tokens from Ably and reconstructs the response in realtime.

Create a new file `subscriber.mjs` with the following contents:

<Code>
```javascript
import Ably from 'ably';

// Initialize Ably Realtime client
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}' });

// Get the same channel used by the publisher
const channel = realtime.channels.get('ai:{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');

// Track responses by message serial
const responses = new Map();

// Subscribe to receive messages
await channel.subscribe((message) => {
  switch (message.action) {
    case 'message.create':
      // New response started
      console.log('\n[Response started]', message.serial);
      responses.set(message.serial, message.data);
      break;

    case 'message.append':
      // Append token to existing response
      const current = responses.get(message.serial) || '';
      responses.set(message.serial, current + message.data);

      // Display token as it arrives
      process.stdout.write(message.data);
      break;

    case 'message.update':
      // Replace entire response content
      responses.set(message.serial, message.data);
      console.log('\n[Response updated with full content]');
      break;
  }
});

console.log('Subscriber ready, waiting for tokens...');
```
</Code>

Subscribers receive different message actions depending on when they join and how they're retrieving messages:

- `message.create`: Indicates a new response has started (i.e. a new message was created). The message `data` contains the initial content (often empty or the first token). Store this as the beginning of a new response using `serial` as the identifier.

- `message.append`: Contains a single token fragment to append. The message `data` contains only the new token, not the full concatenated response. Append this token to the existing response identified by `serial`.

- `message.update`: Contains the whole response up to that point. The message `data` contains the full concatenated text so far. Replace the entire response content with this data for the message identified by `serial`. This action occurs when the channel needs to resynchronize the full message state, such as after a client [resumes](/docs/connect/states#resume) from a transient disconnection.

Run the subscriber in a separate terminal:

<Code>
```shell
node subscriber.mjs
```
</Code>

With the subscriber running, run the publisher in another terminal. The tokens stream in realtime as the AI model generates them.

## Step 5: Stream with multiple publishers and subscribers <a id="step-5"/>

Ably's [channel-oriented sessions](/docs/ai-transport/sessions-identity#connection-oriented-vs-channel-oriented-sessions) enables multiple AI agents to publish responses and multiple users to receive them on a single channel simultaneously. Ably handles message delivery to all participants, eliminating the need to implement routing logic or manage state synchronization across connections.

### Broadcasting to multiple subscribers <a id="broadcasting"/>

Each subscriber receives the complete stream of tokens independently, enabling you to build collaborative experiences or multi-device applications.

Run a subscriber in multiple separate terminals:

<Code>
```shell
# Terminal 1
node subscriber.mjs

# Terminal 2
node subscriber.mjs

# Terminal 3
node subscriber.mjs
```
</Code>

All subscribers receive the same stream of tokens in realtime.

### Publishing concurrent responses <a id="multiple-publishers"/>

Multiple publishers can stream different responses concurrently on the same [channel](/docs/channels). Each response is stored as a separate message with its own `serial`, allowing subscribers to track all responses independently.

To demonstrate this, run a publisher in multiple separate terminals:

<Code>
```shell
# Terminal 1
node publisher.mjs

# Terminal 2
node publisher.mjs

# Terminal 3
node publisher.mjs
```
</Code>

All running subscribers receive tokens from all responses concurrently. Each subscriber correctly reconstructs each response separately using the `serial` to correlate tokens.

## Step 6: Retrieve complete responses from history <a id="step-6"/>

One key advantage of the message-per-response pattern is that each complete AI response is stored as a single message in channel history. This makes it efficient to retrieve conversation history without processing thousands of individual token messages.

Use Ably's [rewind](/docs/channels/options/rewind) channel option to attach to the channel at some point in the recent past and automatically receive complete responses from history. Historical messages are delivered as `message.update` events containing the complete concatenated response, which then seamlessly transition to live `message.append` events for any ongoing responses:

<Code>
```javascript
// Use rewind to receive recent historical messages
const channel = realtime.channels.get('ai:{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}', {
  params: { rewind: '2m' } // Retrieve messages from the last 2 minutes
});

const responses = new Map();

await channel.subscribe((message) => {
  switch (message.action) {
    case 'message.create':
      responses.set(message.serial, message.data);
      break;

    case 'message.append':
      const current = responses.get(message.serial) || '';
      responses.set(message.serial, current + message.data);
      process.stdout.write(message.data);
      break;

    case 'message.update':
      // Historical messages contain full concatenated response
      responses.set(message.serial, message.data);
      console.log('\n[Historical response]:', message.data);
      break;
  }
});
```
</Code>
