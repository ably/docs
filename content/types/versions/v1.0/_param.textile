@Param@ is a type encapsulating a key/value pair. This type is used frequently in method parameters allowing key/value pairs to be used more flexible, see "@Channel#history@":/realtime/history#channel-history for an example.

Please note that @key@ and @value@ attributes are always strings. If an @Integer@ or other value type is expected, then you must coerce that type into a @String@.
