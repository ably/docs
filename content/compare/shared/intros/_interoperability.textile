The modern internet is a web of different languages, platforms, open and proprietary protocols, and services built on top of other services. This isn’t likely to change anytime soon so a platform that supports widespread interoperability is essential in the long-term. There are three questions to help assess how interoperable a platform is:

* How extensive is the support for different languages, frameworks, and protocols?
* How easy is it to migrate to or move away from the platform?
* Are there ‘adapters’ for streaming data into third party platforms?
