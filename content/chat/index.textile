TODO: Introduce Chat/Conversations

h2(#sdk). Chat SDK

Chat is powered by Ably's JavaScript SDK. Use cases include adding required chat features within your chat application such as sending / receiving messages, reacting to messages, using presence to check who is online, when a user was last seen.

Whether you're adding realtime chat capabilities to an existing application, or building a new application from scratch, the Ably SDK enables you to quickly and easily implement the following features:

- "Online status":/chat/features/online-status := the most common way of showing the online status of users in an application.
- "Reactions":/chat/features/reactions := a way to add reaction emojis to existing sent messages within a chat application.
- "Slow mode":/chat/features/slow-mode := used to prevent any individual user from sending an excessive number of messages in a short period of time.

There are several benefits provided by the fact that the Spaces SDK is built on top of the Ably JavaScript SDK:

* "Authentication":/auth and "connection management":/connect are handled by the SDK too.

h2(#status). Development status

The chat API and the chat SDK are in active development which will be used to replace the need for the existing Channel Javascript SDK mentioned above. when the API and SDK is released, we will update our documentation to match the current functionality. Your feedback will help prioritize improvements and fixes in a subsequent release.
