Each enveloped message will have the following fields:

- source := the source for the webhook, namely "@channel.message@" or "@channel.presence@"
- appId := the Ably app this message came from
- channel := the Ably channel where the event occurred
- site := the Ably datacenter which sent the message
- timestamp := a timestamp represented as milliseconds since the epoch for the presence event

In addition, it will contain another field which will contain the actual message, which is named according to the message type.
