h5(#support-push). Push Technology's support

Push Technology has everything you’d expect:

* A dedicated "support center":https://www.pushtechnology.com/support/
* Intercom for live chat
* Email support
* New community-based support using "Stack Overflow":https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/push-diffusion

However, if you need more extensive support you’ll need to buy a support package. This comes in two flavors.
