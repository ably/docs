Presence allows you to know the connection status of a client or a device. Apart from letting you know who is online/offline at a particular point in time, you can also subscribe to presence updates( Note: This is only available with Ably's "Realtime Library":/realtime ). This means that Ably will send a message to all it's presence subscribers whenever a client on the same presence channel that they are subscribed to, has left or a new client has joined.

In addition to these updates about clients entering and leaving, the Presence API also allows you to retrieve a list of members present. This can be done using both Ably's "Realtime":/realtime and "REST":/rest libraries.

Furthermore, if persistence is enabled on the presence channel, you can also retrieve "presence history":/rest/history#presence-history for the channel, i.e, static data about historical presence states of your clients/devices. This operation also can be done using both Ably's "Realtime":/realtime and "REST":/rest libraries.
