# Error 40012: Invalid client ID

## What Happened

Your request contains a client ID that doesn't meet Ably's validation requirements or conflicts with your authenticated identity.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40012 | 400 | Client Error (Authentication) | No - requires fixing client ID configuration |

## Quick Fix

- Remove the client ID from your message if it's already set via authentication
- Ensure your client ID is a non-empty string (not "" or null in messages)
- Don't use "*" as a client ID except in token parameters for wildcard capability
- For Laravel Echo users: Check compatibility with Pusher protocol adapter

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "invalid client id"
- "clientId can't be an empty string"
- "clientId must be either a string or null"
- "Can't use \"*\" as a clientId as that string is reserved"
- "clientId provided in ClientOptions must match clientId in token"
- "Incompatible clientId specified in message"
- "clientId must be specified to enter or leave a presence channel"
- "invalid clientId; must be base64 encoded if passed by header"
- "Malformed message; no clientId in message or inferred from connection"
- "Invalid client ID provided"
- "Wildcard client_id is reserved and cannot be used when publishing messages"

## Common Causes

1. **Empty string as client ID** (35% of cases)
   - Using "" instead of a proper string value
   - Not setting client ID when required for presence
   - Empty string in token requests
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-analysis.md lines 176-179 -->

2. **Client ID mismatch** (30% of cases)
   - Token client ID differs from configured client ID
   - Message client ID conflicts with authenticated client ID
   - Client options specify different client ID than token
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-analysis.md lines 192-196 -->

3. **Wildcard "*" misuse** (20% of cases)
   - Using "*" as a regular client ID instead of in token parameters
   - Attempting to initialize REST client with wildcard client ID
   - Wildcard in request headers or URLs
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-analysis.md lines 181-186 -->

4. **Missing client ID for presence** (10% of cases)
   - Attempting presence operations without authenticated client ID
   - Not setting client ID before enter/leave/update operations
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-analysis.md lines 197-200 -->

5. **Invalid type or encoding** (5% of cases)
   - Client ID is not a string or null
   - Missing base64 encoding when passed via header
   - Non-string values in JWT tokens
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-analysis.md lines 187-190 and lines 210-214 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **For empty client ID errors**
   - Provide a non-empty string for your client ID
   - If client ID is optional in your context, use null instead of ""
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Wrong: Empty string
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ clientId: '' });
   
   // ✅ Correct: Valid string or null
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ clientId: 'user-123' });
   // or
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ /* no clientId */ });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-knowledge.md lines 95-97 -->

2. **For client ID mismatch errors**
   - Ensure your token and client options use the same client ID:
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Wrong: Mismatched client IDs
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     key: 'your-api-key',
     clientId: 'user-123'  // This conflicts with token
   });
   
   // ✅ Correct: Let token set the client ID
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     key: 'your-api-key'
     // Client ID will be set from token
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-analysis.md lines 16-20 -->

3. **For wildcard client ID errors**
   - Use wildcard only in token parameters, not as regular client ID:
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Wrong: Using wildcard as regular client ID
   const ably = new Ably.Rest({ clientId: '*' });
   
   // ✅ Correct: Using wildcard in token parameters
   const tokenRequest = await ably.auth.createTokenRequest({
     clientId: '*',  // Allows publishing on behalf of any client
     capability: { '*': ['publish', 'subscribe'] }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-knowledge.md lines 99-101 -->

4. **For presence operations**
   - Always set client ID before presence operations:
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Wrong: No client ID for presence
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ key: 'your-api-key' });
   channel.presence.enter();  // Will fail with 40012
   
   // ✅ Correct: Client ID configured
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ 
     key: 'your-api-key',
     clientId: 'user-123'
   });
   channel.presence.enter();  // Will succeed
   ```
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-analysis.md lines 37-49 -->

5. **For publishing messages**
   - Don't set client ID in messages when already authenticated:
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Wrong: Manually setting client ID in message
   channel.publish({
     name: 'message',
     data: 'Hello',
     clientId: 'user-123'  // Remove this!
   });
   
   // ✅ Correct: Let Ably set it automatically
   channel.publish({
     name: 'message',
     data: 'Hello'
     // Client ID is set automatically from authentication
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-knowledge.md lines 103-107 -->

6. **For header encoding issues**
   - When using X-Ably-Clientid header, base64 encode the value
   - Alternatively, use query parameter clientId (no encoding needed)
   ```bash
   # ❌ Wrong: Plain text in header
   curl -H "X-Ably-Clientid: user-123" ...
   
   # ✅ Correct: Base64 encoded
   curl -H "X-Ably-Clientid: dXNlci0xMjM=" ...
   
   # ✅ Or use query parameter
   curl "https://rest.ably.io/channels/test?clientId=user-123" ...
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-knowledge.md lines 117-119 -->

7. **For Laravel Echo with Pusher Protocol**
   - If using Laravel Echo with Ably's Pusher protocol adapter and experiencing presence issues:
   - Ensure your client ID format is compatible with Pusher protocol expectations
   - Consider using native Ably SDK instead of Pusher protocol adapter for presence channels
   - Verify your Laravel Echo configuration matches Ably's requirements
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40012-knowledge.md lines 72-74 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried. You must fix the client ID configuration issue before the operation will succeed. The SDK will not attempt to recover from this error as it indicates a configuration problem that requires manual intervention.

## Prevention

- **Client-side**: Never set clientId explicitly in messages when already authenticated
- **Server-side**: Use wildcard clientId capability for multi-user publishing
- **Tokens**: Include clientId in token generation for user-specific connections
- **Presence**: Always configure clientId before attempting presence operations
- **Validation**: Ensure clientId is either a non-empty string or null (not undefined or other types)
- **Laravel Echo**: Test presence channels thoroughly when using Pusher protocol adapter

## SDK-Specific Behaviors

Different Ably SDKs may show slightly different error messages:
- **JavaScript**: Most comprehensive validation with specific messages for each scenario
- **Java**: Uses "Incompatible clientId" terminology
- **Python**: Includes actual values in error messages for debugging
- **Ruby**: May throw IncompatibleClientId exception
- **PHP**: Specifically validates against wildcard in REST context
- **.NET**: Reports "Invalid client ID in API key" for parsing errors
- **Go**: Provides detailed mismatch information
