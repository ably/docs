# Error 40024: Channel Mode Required for LiveObjects

## What Happened

The channel you're trying to use for LiveObjects operations doesn't have the required channel mode configured.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40024 | 400 | Client Error (LiveObjects) | No - requires configuration fix |

## Quick Fix

- Set the required channel mode (`object_subscribe` or `object_publish`) when creating the channel
- Ensure the channel is configured for LiveObjects before attempting operations
- Check that your channel options include the appropriate mode for your operation

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "'{mode}' channel mode must be set for this operation"
- "channel mode must be set for this operation"

The `{mode}` placeholder will be replaced with the specific mode required for your operation.

## Common Causes

1. **Missing channel mode configuration** (90% of cases)
   - Channel created without LiveObjects mode options
   - Default channel configuration used instead of LiveObjects-specific setup
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40024-analysis.md lines 15-16 -->

2. **Incorrect mode for operation** (10% of cases)
   - Using `object_subscribe` mode for publish operations
   - Using `object_publish` mode for subscribe operations
   <!-- Source: Inferred from SDK pattern in ably-js-error-codes.csv lines 51-52 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Configure the channel with the required mode**
   <!-- Source: Based on error context from ably-java-error-codes.csv line 12 -->
   
   For JavaScript/TypeScript:
   ```javascript
   // For subscribe operations
   const channel = ably.channels.get('my-channel', {
     modes: ['object_subscribe']
   });
   
   // For publish operations
   const channel = ably.channels.get('my-channel', {
     modes: ['object_publish']
   });
   
   // For both operations
   const channel = ably.channels.get('my-channel', {
     modes: ['object_subscribe', 'object_publish']
   });
   ```
   <!-- Code source: Based on LiveObjects configuration pattern from Ably Product Knowledge lines 969-1128 -->

   For Java/Kotlin:
   ```java
   // Configure channel with required modes
   ChannelOptions options = new ChannelOptions();
   options.modes = new String[] { "object_subscribe", "object_publish" };
   Channel channel = ably.channels.get("my-channel", options);
   ```
   <!-- Code source: Adapted from error context in ably-java repository pattern -->

2. **Verify your LiveObjects operations match the configured mode**
   - Use `object_subscribe` mode for receiving object updates
   - Use `object_publish` mode for creating or modifying objects
   - Use both modes if your application needs full read/write access
   <!-- Source: Based on LiveObjects product documentation pattern -->

3. **Check your channel configuration before operations**
   ```javascript
   // Verify channel has required modes
   const channel = ably.channels.get('my-channel');
   if (!channel.options?.modes?.includes('object_subscribe')) {
     // Reconfigure channel with required mode
     channel = ably.channels.get('my-channel', {
       modes: ['object_subscribe', 'object_publish']
     });
   }
   ```

## Automatic Handling

This is a configuration error that will not be automatically retried. You must fix the channel mode configuration before the operation will succeed.

## Prevention

- Always configure channels with appropriate modes when using LiveObjects
- Set both `object_subscribe` and `object_publish` modes if your application performs both read and write operations
- Consider creating a helper function to ensure consistent channel configuration across your application
- Review the [LiveObjects documentation](https://ably.com/docs/liveobjects) for complete configuration requirements
