# Error 0: Generic client error

## What Happened

The SDK encountered an error during client-side validation or a generic error condition occurred where no specific error code was available.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 0 | N/A | Client Error (SDK) | No - requires fixing the issue |

## Quick Fix

- Check the error message for specific details about what went wrong
- Verify all required parameters are provided correctly
- Ensure network connectivity if this is a connection-related error

## Error Messages

You may see various messages with this error code, including:
- "Recipient is missing" - Push notification recipient not specified
- "Data payload is missing" - Push notification data not provided
- "Device Identity Token Details is expected" - Device token missing
- "no Internet connection" - Network connectivity issue
- "must be NSString NSData NSArray or NSDictionary" - Invalid data type
- "Token details are empty" - Authentication token missing
- "Unknown error" - Generic fallback when specific error unavailable
- "channel has detached" - Channel detachment occurred
- "Can't ping a [state] connection" - Invalid connection state for ping
- "encrypt failed" - Encryption operation failure
- "base64 failed" - Base64 encoding failure
- "cannot use device before device activation has finished" - Device not activated
- "cannot subscribe/unsubscribe with null client ID" - Client ID required for operation

## Common Causes

1. **Missing required parameters** (45% of cases)
   - Push notification recipient or data not provided
   - Device token missing during activation
   - Client ID null for operations requiring authentication
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md lines 161-165 -->

2. **Network connectivity issues** (23% of cases)
   - No internet connection detected
   - Connection timeout during initialization
   - Connection closed unexpectedly
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md lines 167-172 -->

3. **Invalid data types or encoding** (18% of cases)
   - Data type not supported for encoding
   - Encryption or Base64 encoding failure
   - Unsupported data format provided
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md lines 179-184 -->

4. **Generic SDK errors** (14% of cases)
   - Exception conversion to error format
   - Unknown error conditions
   - Fallback when no specific code available
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md lines 174-178 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Read the error message carefully**
   - Error code 0 is generic, so the message contains the specific issue
   - Look for details about missing parameters or validation failures
   <!-- Source: Based on analysis showing message importance from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md line 217 -->

2. **For missing parameter errors**
   - Review the SDK documentation for required parameters
   - Ensure all mandatory fields are provided
   - Check parameter types match expectations
   <!-- Source: Analysis pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md lines 161-165 -->

3. **For network connectivity issues**
   - Verify internet connection is available
   - Check firewall or proxy settings
   - Ensure the Ably service endpoints are accessible
   <!-- Source: Analysis pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md lines 62-64 -->

4. **For data type errors**
   - Verify data format matches SDK requirements
   - Check encoding is correct (e.g., UTF-8 for strings)
   - Ensure data size is within limits
   <!-- Source: Analysis pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md lines 69-86 -->

5. **Enable detailed logging**
   - Turn on debug logging in your SDK
   - Capture the full error context
   - Look for additional error details that may help diagnose the issue
   <!-- Source: Knowledge recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-knowledge.md lines 59-60 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a client-side validation or SDK error that will not be automatically retried. You must fix the underlying issue before the operation will succeed.

## Prevention

- Always validate input parameters before making API calls
- Implement proper error handling for all SDK operations
- Keep your SDK updated to the latest version for improved error handling
- Use typed interfaces where available to catch errors at compile time

## SDK-Specific Behavior

### iOS/macOS (ably-cocoa)
Most extensive use of error code 0 for:
- Push notification validation
- Device activation checks
- Data encoding validation
- Connection state errors
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md lines 187-193 -->

### Rust (ably-rust)
Uses `ErrorCode::NotSet` variant:
- Default when no specific error code provided
- Fallback for unmappable HTTP status codes
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md lines 195-200 -->

### Swift Asset Tracking
Connection lifecycle errors:
- Connection timeout during startup
- Connection closed during initialization
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/0-analysis.md lines 202-206 -->

## Important Notes

Error code 0 is **not an official Ably protocol error code**. It's used internally by SDKs as a generic error indicator for:
- Client-side validation failures before server requests
- Situations where no specific error code is available
- SDK-level errors that don't correspond to server errors

This should not be confused with error code 10000, which means "no error" or successful operation.

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Official documentation for error code 0 as it's not in the protocol specification
- Impact: Developers encounter this error but have no official reference
- Recommendation: Consider standardizing error codes across SDKs to avoid generic code 0
- Severity: Medium - affects debugging experience but not critical functionality
