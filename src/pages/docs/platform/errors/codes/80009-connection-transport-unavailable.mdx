# Error 80009: Connection transport unavailable

## What Happened

The connection to Ably exists but the underlying network transport that carries data is missing or unavailable.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 80009 | 500 | Connection Error | Yes - requires new connection |

## Quick Fix

- Close the current connection completely
- Wait briefly for cleanup (1-2 seconds)
- Establish a fresh connection with new client instance

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Connection not established no transport handle: {connectionId}"
- "auth_callback failed: {error message}" (Ruby SDK)
- "auth_url failed: {error message}" (Ruby SDK)

## Common Causes

1. **Transport initialization failure** (60% of cases)
   - Network transport never properly initialized
   - Transport cleaned up while still needed
   - Platform-specific network restrictions
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80009-knowledge.md lines 11-18 -->

2. **Authentication operation failures** (30% of cases)
   - Auth callback throwing exceptions
   - Auth URL request failing or timing out
   - Token request operations interrupted
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80009-analysis.md lines 16-29 -->

3. **Comet transport issues** (10% of cases - historical)
   - Comet fallback transport failing on certain browsers
   - Transport POST requests returning 404
   - Windows Chrome environments affected
   <!-- Source: Historical case from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80009-knowledge.md lines 92-103 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Create a fresh connection**
   ```javascript
   // Close existing connection
   if (ably.connection.state !== 'closed') {
     ably.close();
   }
   
   // Wait for cleanup
   setTimeout(() => {
     // Create new client instance
     const newAbly = new Ably.Realtime({ key: apiKey });
     
     // Monitor connection state
     newAbly.connection.on('connected', () => {
       console.log('Successfully reconnected');
     });
   }, 1000);
   ```
   <!-- Source: Resolution approach from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80009-knowledge.md lines 27-33 -->

2. **For authentication-related failures (Ruby SDK)**
   - Verify auth callback completes within timeout period
   - Check auth URL endpoint is responsive
   - Ensure network connectivity during token requests
   <!-- Source: Ruby SDK implementation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80009-analysis.md lines 44-58 -->

3. **For legacy Comet transport issues**
   ```javascript
   // Force WebSocket transport to avoid Comet issues
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     key: apiKey,
     transports: ['web_socket']
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Historical workaround from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80009-knowledge.md lines 101-102, lines 160-162 -->

4. **Monitor system resources**
   - Check device memory usage
   - Restart app if memory usage is high
   - Close other network-intensive applications
   <!-- Source: Troubleshooting advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80009-knowledge.md lines 35-39 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs do not automatically recover from this error. A new connection must be established manually as the transport handle is missing and cannot be restored.
<!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80009-knowledge.md lines 22-24 -->

## Prevention

- Always close connections properly before creating new ones
- Don't attempt to reuse connection objects that have failed
- Implement proper connection lifecycle management
- For web applications, consider forcing WebSocket transport if Comet issues occur

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Detailed explanation of transport handle lifecycle and management
- Impact: Makes it harder for users to understand why transport handles become unavailable
- Recommendation: Add section on transport handle management to connection documentation
- Severity: Medium - users can work around but lack understanding of root cause
-->
