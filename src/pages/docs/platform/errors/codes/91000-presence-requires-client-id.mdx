# Error 91000: Presence requires client ID

## What Happened

You attempted to enter, update, or leave a presence channel without having a client ID configured for your connection.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 91000 | 400 | Client Error (Presence) | No - requires setting client ID |

## Quick Fix

- Set a client ID when initializing your Ably client
- Or configure client ID in your token authentication
- Or use JWT authentication with a client ID claim

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "unable to enter presence channel (no clientId)"
- "Invalid attempt to enter with no clientId"
- "Unable to enter create presence message without a client_id"

## Common Causes

1. **No client ID configured** (90% of cases)
   - Creating an Ably client without specifying a client ID
   - Using basic authentication without setting client ID
   - Missing client ID in token parameters
   - Quick-start implementations often miss this requirement
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91000-analysis.md lines 88-93 -->

2. **Anonymous connection attempting presence** (8% of cases)
   - Default connections don't have client IDs
   - Demo applications without proper authentication setup
   - First-time developers not aware of clientId requirement
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91000-knowledge.md lines 40-44 and Slack discussion lines 79-86 -->

3. **Client ID lost during authentication renewal** (2% of cases)
   - Token renewal didn't include client ID
   - JWT token missing client ID claim
   - Cached token with outdated client ID
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91000-analysis.md lines 126-131 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Set client ID in client options**
   ```javascript
   // JavaScript/Node.js example
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     key: 'your-api-key',
     clientId: 'unique-user-id' // Add this line
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91000-knowledge.md lines 23-28 -->

2. **Configure client ID via token authentication**
   ```javascript
   // Request a token with client ID
   const tokenParams = {
     clientId: 'unique-user-id'
   };
   const token = await ably.auth.requestToken(tokenParams);
   
   // Or use token callback
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     authCallback: async (tokenParams, callback) => {
       const token = await fetchTokenFromServer({
         clientId: 'unique-user-id'
       });
       callback(null, token);
     }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91000-knowledge.md lines 30-35 -->

3. **Use JWT with client ID claim**
   ```javascript
   // Server-side JWT generation should include client ID
   const jwt = generateJWT({
     'x-ably-clientId': 'unique-user-id',
     // other claims...
   });
   
   // Client-side usage
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     authUrl: '/auth',
     authMethod: 'GET'
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91000-analysis.md lines 130-131 -->

4. **Verify client ID is set before presence operations**
   ```javascript
   // Check if client ID is configured
   console.log('Client ID:', ably.auth.clientId);
   
   // Only attempt presence if client ID exists
   if (ably.auth.clientId) {
     await channel.presence.enter();
   } else {
     console.error('Client ID required for presence operations');
   }
   ```
   <!-- Source: Based on SDK validation patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91000-analysis.md lines 25-57 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried. You must configure a client ID before the presence operation will succeed. The error is thrown during pre-flight validation before any network request is made.

## SDK-Specific Behavior

Different SDKs validate client ID at different points:
- **Go SDK**: Validates on Enter, Update, and Leave operations
- **Java SDK**: Validates in Auth.checkClientId() method
- **Ruby SDK**: Validates in enter_with_presence_message()
- **.NET SDK**: Uses error constant UnableToEnterPresenceChannelNoClientId

All SDKs throw error 91000 consistently when client ID is missing.
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91000-analysis.md lines 88-111 -->

## Prevention

- **Always set client ID for presence-enabled applications**: Configure during initialization or authentication
- **Use meaningful identifiers**: User IDs, usernames, or session IDs work well
- **Maintain consistency**: Use the same client ID across reconnections for the same user
- **Validate before presence operations**: Check that client ID exists before calling presence methods
- **Include in token renewal**: Ensure client ID persists through token refreshes
<!-- Source: Knowledge best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/91000-knowledge.md lines 57-63 -->

## Security Considerations

- **Use token authentication for production**: Basic authentication with client ID can be spoofed
- **Server-side validation**: Generate tokens server-side to ensure client ID authenticity
- **Avoid sensitive data**: Don't use personal information as client IDs
- **Unique identifiers**: Ensure each user has a unique client ID to prevent conflicts
- **Consistent assignment**: Server should control client ID assignment for security

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Clear example of JWT token with clientId claim in presence documentation
- Impact: Developers using JWT auth may not know how to include clientId properly
- Recommendation: Add JWT clientId example to https://ably.com/docs/presence
- Severity: Medium - JWT is increasingly common authentication method
-->
