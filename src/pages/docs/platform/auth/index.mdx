Ably provides secure authentication mechanisms across all of its products and services including Pub/Sub, Chat, LiveObjects, Spaces, and Asset Tracking. Before any client or server can interact with Ably services, it must authenticate using an Ably API key or token.

## Authentication Options

There are two methods of authentication available, key and token authentication:

### Key Authentication

Key authentication uses your Ably API key directly and is designed for trusted server environments.

**When to use:**
- Server-side applications
- Secure environments where API keys can be safely stored
- Backend services and servers

**Benefits:**
- Simple to implement
- No token expiration to manage
- Full access to API key capabilities

### Token Authentication

Token authentication uses short-lived tokens issued by your servers for client applications. **This is the recommended approach for client-side authentication.**

**When to use:**
- Web browsers and mobile applications
- Any untrusted client environment
- When you need fine-grained access control

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced security - tokens expire automatically
- Fine-grained permissions per token
- Ability to revoke access if needed
- Identity management through `clientId`

## API Keys

Every Ably app can have multiple API keys, each with different capabilities and permissions. API keys are the foundation of Ably's authentication system.

### API Key Structure

An Ably API key (`I2E_JQ.OqUdfg:EVKVTCBlzLBPYJiCZTsIW_pqylJ9WVRB5K9P19Ap1y0`) has three components:

1. **App ID** (`I2E_JQ`) - Identifies your Ably application
2. **Key ID** (`OqUdfg`) - Identifies the specific API key
3. **Key Secret** (`EVKVTCBlzLBPYJiCZTsIW_pqylJ9WVRB5K9P19Ap1y0`) - Private secret for authentication

**Important:** The key secret should never be shared with untrusted parties or embedded in client applications.

## Client Identity

Ably supports client identity through the `clientId` parameter, which allows you to:

- Identify specific users or devices
- Implement presence features
- Apply user-specific permissions
- Track user activity across sessions

The `clientId` can be set during authentication and is included in all messages and presence events from that client.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never use key authentication client-side** - Always use token authentication for browsers and mobile apps
2. **Set appropriate token expiry times** - Balance security with user experience
3. **Use `clientId` for user identity** - This enables presence and user-specific features
4. **Implement proper token refresh** - Ensure seamless user experience when tokens expire
5. **Apply principle of least privilege** - Grant only the minimum required permissions
