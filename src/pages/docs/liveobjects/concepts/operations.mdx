LiveObjects operations define how object data is updated and synchronized across multiple clients.

When you create or update an object, the change is expressed as an _operation_ that is sent as an [object message](/docs/metadata-stats/stats#messages) on the channel. The operation is then applied to the object instance on all clients that are subscribed to the channel.

<Aside data-type='see-evidence'>
Applications maintain their state during disruptions. All messages are received in correct order with zero message loss. [See evidence here 🕵️](/docs/platform/architecture/connection-recovery)
</Aside>

This document explains the key concepts you need to know when working with operations.

## Operation types <a id="operation-types"/>

Each object type supports specific operations that modify the object's data.

### LiveMap operations <a id="livemap"/>

[LiveMap](/docs/liveobjects/map) supports the following operations:

* `set`: Set a value for a key
* `remove`: Remove a key and its value

The value of an entry in a `LiveMap` instance can be a [primitive type](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#primitive-types) or a [reference](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#composability) to another object.

<Code>
```javascript
await myObject.get('user').set('username', 'alice');
await myObject.get('user').remove('status');
```

```swift
// Set a value for a key
try await map.set(key: "username", value: "alice")

// Remove a key
try await map.remove(key: "username")
```

```java
// Set a value for a key
map.set("username", LiveMapValue.of("alice"));

// Remove a key
map.remove("username");
```
</Code>

### LiveCounter operations <a id="livecounter"/>

[LiveCounter](/docs/liveobjects/counter) supports the following operations:

* `increment`: Increment the counter by a specified amount
* `decrement`: Decrement the counter by a specified amount

The amount is a double-precision floating-point number, which is the same as underlying type of a [LiveCounter](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#livecounter) value.

<Aside data-type='note'>
The `decrement` operation is just syntactic sugar for `increment` with a negative amount.
</Aside>

<Code>
```javascript
await myObject.get('visits').increment(5);
await myObject.get('score').decrement(2);
```

```swift
// Increment counter by 5
try await counter.increment(amount: 5)

// Decrement counter by 2
try await counter.decrement(amount: 2)
```

```java
// Increment counter by 5
counter.increment(5);

// Decrement counter by 2
counter.decrement(2);
```
</Code>

### Create operations <a id="create-operations"/>

Create operations are used to instantiate new objects of a given type.

<If lang="javascript">
Use `LiveMap.create()` and `LiveCounter.create()` to create new objects. These methods create special value types that can be assigned directly to paths:

<Code>
```javascript
// Create and assign a map with initial values
await myObject.set('user', LiveMap.create({
  username: 'alice',
  status: 'online'
}));

// Create and assign a counter with initial value
await myObject.set('score', LiveCounter.create(100));

// Create nested structures
await myObject.set('profile', LiveMap.create({
  name: 'Alice',
  score: LiveCounter.create(0),
  settings: LiveMap.create({
    theme: 'dark',
    notifications: true
  })
}));
```
</Code>

When a create operation is processed, an [object ID](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#object-ids) is automatically generated for the new object instance.

<Aside data-type='note'>
Objects created with `LiveMap.create()` and `LiveCounter.create()` are automatically [reachable](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#reachability) when you assign them to a path. You don't need to worry about [orphaned objects](/docs/liveobjects/lifecycle#objects-deleted) unless you explicitly remove them from the tree and you have retained an `Instance` for the now-unreachable object.
</Aside>
</If>

<If lang="swift,java">
A create operation can optionally specify an initial value for the object.

<Code>
```swift
// Create a map with initial values
let userMap = try await channel.objects.createMap(entries: [
    "username": "alice",
    "status": "online",
])

// Create a counter with initial value
let scoreCounter = try await channel.objects.createCounter(count: 100)
```

```java
// Create a map with initial values
Map<String, LiveMapValue> entries = Map.of(
    "username", LiveMapValue.of("alice"),
    "status", LiveMapValue.of("online")
);
LiveMap userMap = channel.getObjects().createMap(entries);

// Create a counter with initial value
LiveCounter scoreCounter = channel.getObjects().createCounter(100);
```
</Code>

When a create operation is processed, an [object ID](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#object-ids) for the new object instance is automatically generated for the object.

<Aside data-type='important'>
Newly created objects are not automatically [reachable](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#reachability) from the <If lang="javascript">channel object</If><If lang="swift,java">root object</If>. You must explicitly add them to the object tree to prevent garbage collection.
</Aside>
</If>

## Object IDs <a id="object-ids"/>

Every operation is expressed relative to a specific object instance, identified by its [object ID](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#object-ids), which determines which object the operation is applied to.

<If lang="javascript">
When using a `PathObject`, the specific object instance at the given path is evaluated at the time a method is called that updates the object. The client library will then publish an operation targeting the resolved object.
</If>

When using a client library object IDs are handled automatically, allowing you work directly with object references:

<Code>
```javascript
// The published operation targets the object ID of the object at 'user'
await myObject.get('user').set('username', 'alice');

// Get the specific instance and its ID
const userInstance = myObject.get('user').instance();
if (userInstance) {
  console.log('Object ID:', userInstance.id());
  await userInstance.set('username', 'alice');
}
```

```swift
// The published operation targets the object ID of the `userMap` object instance
try await userMap.set(key: "username", "alice")
```

```java
// The published operation targets the object ID of the `userMap` object instance
userMap.set("username", LiveMapValue.of("alice"));
```
</Code>

<If lang="swift,java">
Therefore it is important that you obtain an up-to-date object instance before performing operations on an object. For example, you can [subscribe](/docs/liveobjects/map#subscribe-data) to a `LiveMap` instance to ensure you always have an up-to-date reference to any child objects in the map:

<Code>
{ /* We can't map the JS example directly because Swift concurrency prevents us from mutating local variables in the way that the JS example does, so I tried to show how we might need to handle this scenario in a real-world app where things are isolated to the main actor. But it's long and ugly. */ }
```swift
struct MyView: View {
    var root: any LiveMap
    @State private var myCounter: (any LiveCounter)?

    var body: some View {
        Button("Increment the counter") {
            Task {
                try await myCounter?.increment(amount: 1)
            }
        }.onAppear {
            do {
                myCounter = try root.get(key: "myCounter")?.liveCounterValue

                // We keep a reference to the latest value that the root map
                // stores at the "myCounter" key, to ensure that upon tapping
                // the button, we increment the correct counter.

                try root.subscribe { _, _ in
                    MainActor.assumeIsolated {
                        do {
                            myCounter = try root.get(key: "myCounter")?.liveCounterValue
                        } catch {
                            // Error handling of root.get(key:) omitted for brevity
                        }
                    }
                }
            } catch {
                // Error handling of root.get(key:) omitted for brevity
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```java
LiveMap root = channel.getObjects().getRoot();

// Keep a reference to the counter object
LiveCounter myCounter = root.get("myCounter").asLiveCounter();

// Subscribe to root changes to keep counter reference up-to-date
root.subscribe((mapUpdate) -> {
    if (mapUpdate.getUpdate().containsKey("myCounter")) {
        myCounter = root.get("myCounter").asLiveCounter();
    }
});

// Before incrementing, ensure we have an up-to-date object reference if
// the counter instance at the 'myCounter' key in the root map changes
myCounter.increment(1);
```
</Code>
</If>

In the [REST API](/docs/liveobjects/rest-api-usage#updating-objects-by-id), the relationship between operations and object IDs is made explicit:

<Code>
```shell
curl -X POST https://main.realtime.ably.net/channels/my-channel/objects \
 -u "{{API_KEY}}"
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data \
'{
  "operation": "MAP_SET",
  "objectId": "root",
  "data": {"key": "username", "value": {"string": "alice"}}
}'
```
</Code>

<If lang="javascript">

## Batch operations <a id="batch-operations"/>

[Batch operations](/docs/liveobjects/batch) can be used to batch a set of operations together:

* Multiple operations are grouped into a single atomic unit
* All operations in the batch either succeed together or fail together
* Operations in a batch are sent as a single message
* No operations from other clients can be interleaved within a batch

## Object message properties <a id="properties"/>

Each operation is carried by an `ObjectMessage`, which is surfaced in [subscriptions](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/path-object#subscribe) and provides metadata about the operation and who performed it.

### ObjectMessage <a id="object-message"/>

The following are the properties of an `ObjectMessage`:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **id** | Unique ID assigned by Ably to this object message |
| **clientId** | The [ID of the client](/docs/auth/identified-clients) that published this operation |
| **connectionId** | The ID of the connection used to publish this operation |
| **timestamp** | The timestamp of when the object message was received by Ably, as milliseconds since the Unix epoch |
| **channel** | The name of the channel the object message was published to |
| **operation** | An [`ObjectOperation`](#object-operation) describing the operation that was applied |
| **serial** | An opaque string that uniquely identifies this object message |
| **serialTimestamp** | A timestamp derived from the `serial` field |
| **siteCode** | An opaque string that uniquely identifies the Ably site the object message was published to |
| **extras** | A JSON object of arbitrary key-value pairs that may contain metadata, and/or ancillary payloads. Valid payloads include `headers` |

### ObjectOperation <a id="object-operation"/>

The `operation` field of an `ObjectMessage` contains an `ObjectOperation` with the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **action** | The operation action. One of: `'map.create'`, `'map.set'`, `'map.remove'`, `'counter.create'`, `'counter.inc'`, or `'object.delete'` |
| **objectId** | The ID of the object the operation was applied to |
| **mapOp** | Present for map mutation operations (`'map.set'`, `'map.remove'`). Contains `key` (the key that was modified) and optionally `data` (an `ObjectData` representing the value assigned to the key, present only for `'map.set'` operations) |
| **counterOp** | Present for counter increment operations (`'counter.inc'`). Contains `amount` (the value added to the counter) |
| **map** | Present for `'map.create'` operations. Defines the initial value of the map object with optional `semantics` (conflict-resolution strategy) and `entries` (initial key-value pairs) |
| **counter** | Present for `'counter.create'` operations. Defines the initial value of the counter object with optional `count` (initial counter value) |

#### ObjectData

The `data` field in `mapOp` is an `ObjectData` object that represents the value assigned to a map key. It has the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **objectId** | A reference to another object (such as a `LiveMap` or `LiveCounter`) by its object ID. Present when the value is a LiveObject |
| **value** | A decoded primitive value (string, number, boolean, JSON-serializable object or array, or binary data). Present when the value is a primitive type |
