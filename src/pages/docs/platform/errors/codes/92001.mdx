This error code has two different meanings depending on the Ably feature you're using. It either indicates a channel encryption configuration issue (Ruby SDK) or that you've exceeded the LiveObjects limit.

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 92001 | 400 | Configuration Error | No |

## Error messages

| Message | Context |
|---------|---------|
| "Message cannot be decrypted as the channel is not set up for encryption & decryption" | Ruby SDK with channel encryption |
| "Objects limit exceeded" | LiveObjects feature |

## Impact

This error prevents the current operation from completing:
- **For encryption errors**: Messages cannot be decrypted and will be dropped
- **For LiveObjects**: New objects cannot be created until the limit is resolved

The error will not be automatically retried as it indicates a configuration or limit issue that requires manual intervention.

## Troubleshooting

### Scenario 1: Channel encryption configuration (Ruby SDK)

This occurs when:
- An encrypted message is received on a channel
- The receiving channel doesn't have cipher parameters configured
- There's a mismatch between sender and receiver encryption settings

To resolve this:

1. **Configure encryption on all clients accessing the channel**
   - Ensure all clients use identical cipher parameters
   - See the [encryption documentation](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/encryption) for configuration details

2. **Verify cipher parameters match across all clients**
   - Use the same encryption key and algorithm
   - Store cipher keys securely in environment variables

### Scenario 2: LiveObjects limit exceeded

This occurs when:
- The maximum number of objects on a channel exceeds your account limit
- You're trying to create new LiveObjects when at capacity

To resolve this:

1. **Remove unnecessary objects from the channel**
   - Delete objects that are no longer needed
   - Review your object lifecycle management

2. **Upgrade your package for higher limits**
   - Contact your account manager to increase limits
   - Review the [pricing page](https://ably.com/pricing) for package options

## Prevention

### For encryption issues:
- Document encryption requirements for all channels
- Use consistent cipher configuration across your application
- Test encryption setup during development

### For LiveObjects limits:
- Monitor object usage against your limits
- Implement cleanup routines for old objects
- Plan capacity based on expected usage

{/* DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Clear documentation about the error code conflict between Ruby SDK and LiveObjects
- Impact: Customers receive conflicting guidance depending on which documentation they find
- Recommendation: Reassign one of the error codes to eliminate the conflict
- Severity: High - causes customer confusion and support burden
*/}
