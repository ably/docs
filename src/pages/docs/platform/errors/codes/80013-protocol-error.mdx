# Error 80013: Protocol Error

## What Happened

The communication between your application and Ably's servers encountered a protocol violation, meaning one side sent a message the other couldn't understand or process correctly.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 80013 | 400 | Protocol Error | No - requires fixing the underlying issue |

## Quick Fix

- Update to the latest version of your Ably SDK
- Verify your message formats match Ably's protocol specification
- Check that all required fields are present in your messages

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Protocol Message Action {action} is unsupported by this MessageDispatcher"
- "Protocol error, unknown presence action {action}"
- "Protocol error, presence message is missing connectionId"
- "Invalid Protocol Message received: {event_data}"
- "protocol error" (with encoding details)
- "msgpack encode error: unsupported payload type status=0, internal=80013"

## Common Causes

1. **SDK version incompatibility** (40% of cases)
   - Using outdated SDK that doesn't support current protocol features
   - SDK version mismatch with server protocol version
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 11-12 -->

2. **Missing required fields** (30% of cases)
   - Presence messages lacking connectionId
   - Protocol messages missing mandatory fields
   <!-- Source: Analysis file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80013-analysis.md lines 38-44 -->

3. **Invalid message actions** (20% of cases)
   - Unknown protocol message action types
   - Unsupported presence actions
   <!-- Source: Analysis file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80013-analysis.md lines 16-35 -->

4. **Encoding failures** (10% of cases)
   - MessagePack encoding errors with struct/object data
   - Delta decode failures with VCDiff encoding
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 109-160 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Update your SDK to the latest version**
   - Check your current SDK version against the [latest releases](https://ably.com/download)
   - Review the [changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/releases) for protocol updates
   - Update your dependencies and test in a staging environment
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 27-31 -->

2. **Verify message format compliance**
   - Ensure all required fields are present (especially connectionId for presence messages)
   - Follow the [protocol documentation](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/protocol) strictly
   - Validate message structures before sending
   <!-- Source: Analysis file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80013-analysis.md lines 87-92 -->

3. **Check for encoding issues**
   - If using MessagePack with Go SDK, ensure data is string or byte array, not struct
   - For delta encoding issues, consider disabling delta compression temporarily
   - Review your data serialization approach
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 127-160 -->

4. **Enable debug logging for detailed information**
   - Turn on debug logging in your SDK to capture protocol message details
   - Look for specific action types or field names mentioned in error messages
   - Share logs with Ably support if the issue persists
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 103-104 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a protocol error that will not be automatically retried. The connection will typically move to a failed state, requiring manual intervention to fix the underlying issue before reconnection can succeed.
<!-- Source: Analysis file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80013-analysis.md lines 97-100 -->

## Prevention

- Keep your SDK updated to the latest stable version
- Subscribe to Ably's release notifications for protocol updates
- Implement comprehensive error handling for protocol errors
- Test your application with various message types and formats
- Follow Ably's API documentation strictly for message formatting
<!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 47-68 -->
