# Error 50300: Service Unavailable

## What Happened
A required service within Ably's infrastructure is temporarily unavailable, preventing your request from being processed.

## Quick Reference
| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 50300 | 503 | Server Error (Infrastructure) | Yes - temporary service issue |

## Quick Fix
- No immediate action required - Ably SDKs handle retry automatically
- Check [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) if persistent
- Wait 30-60 seconds before manual retry if needed

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Service Unavailable"
- "failed to make request: [details]"
- "Active Traffic Management: traffic is being temporarily redirected to a backup service"
- "Ably's routing layer was unable to service this request"

## Common Causes

1. **Temporary infrastructure issues** (60% of cases)
   - Service maintenance or deployment
   - Routing layer temporarily unavailable
   - Infrastructure capacity adjustments
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50300-knowledge.md lines 29-30 -->

2. **Moderation service unavailable** (25% of cases)
   - External moderation service unreachable
   - Network connectivity issues between services
   - Moderation service experiencing downtime
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50300-analysis.md lines 23-30 -->

3. **Active Traffic Management** (15% of cases)
   - Emergency traffic redirection to backup clusters
   - Planned infrastructure migration
   - Regional failover scenarios
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50300-knowledge.md lines 69-90 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **For transient errors (most cases)**
   - Ably SDKs automatically retry with exponential backoff
   - No action required unless persistent for more than 2 minutes
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50300-knowledge.md lines 124-125 -->

2. **For persistent errors (>2 minutes)**
   - Check https://status.ably.com for any ongoing incidents
   - Review response headers for alternate endpoints:
     - `X-Ably-Serverid`: Identifies which router responded
     - May include alternate `realtimeHost` or `restHost` during traffic management
   - Note any custom error messages that provide specific guidance
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50300-knowledge.md lines 36-44, 74-89 -->

3. **If using Chat with moderation enabled**
   - The error may indicate moderation service issues
   - Messages will be queued and retried automatically
   - Consider temporarily disabling moderation if time-critical
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50300-analysis.md lines 15-21 -->

4. **Monitor and verify recovery**
   - Errors should resolve within minutes
   - If persistent beyond 5 minutes, note the request ID and server ID from headers
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50300-knowledge.md lines 119-122 -->

## Automatic Handling
Ably SDKs automatically retry 503 errors with exponential backoff. The SDK will:
- Retry with increasing delays (starting at ~1 second)
- Continue retrying for up to 2 minutes
- Fall back to alternate endpoints if provided
- Queue messages during temporary disconnections
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50300-knowledge.md lines 124-127 -->

## Prevention

While 503 errors are typically infrastructure-related and outside your control:
- Implement robust error handling for service unavailability
- Consider implementing circuit breakers for non-critical features
- Monitor for patterns in your application logs
- Subscribe to [Ably status updates](https://status.ably.com) for proactive notifications
