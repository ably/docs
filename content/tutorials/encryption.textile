Ably's "encryption feature":/channels/options/encryption enables you to send encrypted messages on channels that can later be retrieved and decrypted using a common cryptographic key known only to the client and server. This has the advantage that Ably demonstrably has no access to the un-encrypted contents of your messages, but also means that each app is responsible for enabling the distribution of keys to clients independently of Ably.

Using our "encryption API":/channels/options/encryption is easy.  Let's get started.

  "See setup in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/encryption-nodejs-setup

h2(#install-ably). Step 2 - Install Ably

blang[java].
  To start using Ably in your JRE application, you need to include the Ably Client library. We recommend that you include the latest client library via Gradle in your project's @gradle.build@ file.

  ```[groovy]
  apply plugin: 'application'
  mainClassName = 'io.ably.tutorial.Example'

  repositories {
    jcenter()
  }

  dependencies {
      compile 'io.ably:ably-java:1.2.0'
  }
  ```

  In the above example a specific version of the library is referenced, however we recommend you check which is the latest stable version and always use that. Follow link to get the latest stable release for "Java":https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ably/ably-java/latest.

  Now that you have your API key, let's define a constant @API_KEY@ in @Constants.java@.

  Remember to replace @'INSERT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE'@ with your Ably API key from Step #1.

  ```[java]
        class Constants {
        static final String API_KEY = "INSERT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE";
        /* Sign up at ably.com to get your API key */

        /* RuntimeException will be thrown if API_KEY is not set to a proper one */
        static {
        if (Constants.API_KEY.contains("INSERT")) {
            throw new RuntimeException("API key is not set, sign up on ably.com to get yours");
        }
     }
    }
  ```
  Create another class @Publisher@ and initialize @AblyRealtime@ with your @API_KEY@ as follows:

  ```[java]
     import static io.ably.tutorial.Constants.API_KEY;
     import io.ably.lib.realtime.AblyRealtime;
     import io.ably.lib.types.AblyException;

     public class Publisher {
         public static void main(String[] args) throws AblyException {
             AblyRealtime ablyRealtime = new AblyRealtime(API_KEY);

         }
     }
  ```
  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/encryption-java-step-2

blang[javascript].
  Let's create a @publisher.html@ with a input for message to be published and a button to execute the publish action, as shown below:

  ```[html]
     <html lang="en">
       <body>
         <h1>Publish Encrypted Messages</h1><br><br>
         <label for="message">Message</label>
         <input type="text" id="message">
         <button id="publish">Publish</button>
       </body>
     </html>
  ```

  To start using Ably in your web app, you first need to include the Ably library.
  We recommend that you include the latest client library from our CDN using a simple @<script>@ tag.
  The client library must be instantiated with the API key you copied in Step 1.
  Note in production we recommend you always use the "token authentication scheme":/auth/token for browser clients, however in this example we use an API key for simplicity.

  Include the code below just before your closing your HTML @</html>@ tag.

  ```[html]
     <!-- Include the latest Ably Library  -->
     <script src="https://cdn.ably.com/lib/ably.min-1.js"></script>

     <!-- Instantiate the Ably library  -->
     <script type="text/javascript">
       var realtime = new Ably.Realtime('INSERT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE');
     </script>
  ```

  **What have we setup in @publisher.html@ so far?**

  # We have added a text box to accept message input from user.
  # We have provided a button to encrypt and publish the input message. We'll see how in the following step.
  # We added Ably library and configured it with our API key. Remember to replace @'INSERT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE'@ with your Ably API key from Step #1

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/encryption-js-step2

blang[nodejs].
  The Ably Realtime and REST libraries are available as an "NPM module":https://www.npmjs.com/package/ably.
  Simply add it to the @package.json@ file of your NodeJs project.

  ```[json]
  {
      ...
      "dependencies": {
          "ably": ">=1.2"
          ...
      }
  }
  ```

  and run:

  ```[sh]
  npm install
  ```

  or install it using @npm install@:

  ```[sh]
  npm install ably
  ```

  The client library must be instantiated with the API key you copied in Step 1. API keys used with "basic authentication":/auth/basic for your own servers is generally preferred, however,  clients running on insecure devices should always use the "token authentication scheme":/auth/token instead. In this example, we use an API key for simplicity.


  Add the following to @constants.js@ to define constants we'll use throughout our project:

  ```[nodejs]
    const API_KEY = 'INSERT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE'; /* Add your API key here */
    if (API_KEY.indexOf('INSERT') === 0) {
        throw('Cannot run without an API key. Add your key to this file.');
    }

    module.exports = {
        API_KEY: API_KEY
    };
  ```

  Here we defined just one constant @API_KEY@. Remember to replace @'INSERT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE'@ with your Ably API key from Step #1

  Now, let's create a @publisher.js@ with the following content:

  ```[nodejs]
    const Ably = require('ably');
    const constants = require('./constants');

    /* instantiate the Ably library */
    const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({key: constants.API_KEY});
  ```

  Here, we're simply importing @Ably@ and @constants.js@.
  Then we define a @Realtime@ instance, which we'll use to obtain a channel in the next steps.

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/encryption-nodejs-step2

h2(#publish-messages). Step 3 - Publish encrypted messages to a channel

Let's see how to leverage the encryption API to publish encrypted messages to a channel.

blang[java].
  For that purpose, let's define a few constants in @Constants.java@ class:
  1) @CIPHER_KEY_BASE64@: the base 64 key we'll use to encrypt the messages with
  2) @CHANNEL_NAME@: name of the channel we'll publish the messages to

  ```[java]
    static final String CIPHER_KEY_BASE64 = "G98udOf2gFPJd0ITsIng8DdQJ32yhAjtRdTsMnCqkmw=";
    static final String CHANNEL_NAME = "encrypted:messages";
  ```

  Note: A sample cipher key is provided here for simplicity.
  Alternatively, one could use the io.ably.lib.util.Crypto.generateRandomKey() utility method to generate a valid key.

  Now, let's have a look at how to publish encrypted messages to a channel in the @Publisher.java@ class

  ```[java]
  public class Publisher {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws AblyException {
      AblyRealtime ablyRealtime = new AblyRealtime(API_KEY);
      ChannelOptions options = ChannelOptions.fromCipherKey(CIPHER_KEY_BASE64);
      Channel channel = ablyRealtime.channels.get(CHANNEL_NAME, options);

      channel.publish(CHANNEL_NAME, "encrypted secret payload");
    }
  }
  ```

  **What is going on in the code block above?**

  # We create a @ChannelOptions@ object that specifies the cipher key that we intend to use for the encryption. Note that the @cipher key@ should not be a pass-phrase, but a cryptographic key - generated from a secure random source, 128 or 256 bits long, binary or base64-encoded. If you wish to encrypt messages with a pass-phrase (for example, one entered by a user), you should use a "key derivation function":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function to transform that into a key. Here we could also use an Ably utility (@Crypto.generateRandomKey()@) to generate a random key.
  # We then obtain a @Channel@ instance for publishing messages. Notice how we pass the @ChannelOptions@ object. This helps us configure the @Channel@ instance further to encrypt the messages before they are published.
  # And lastly, we publish a message to the @CHANNEL_NAME@ channel by simply calling the @publish()@ method.
  # In the next step we'll see how easy it is to retrieve and decrypt this encrypted message.

  Let's update our @build.gradle@ file to apply @java@ plugin and add a gradle task @publish@ so that we can execute @Publisher@ from commandline:

  ```[groovy]
    apply plugin: 'java'
    ...
    task(publish, dependsOn: 'classes', type: JavaExec) {
        main = 'io.ably.tutorial.Publisher'
        classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
    }
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/encryption-java-step-3


blang[javascript].
  Let's create a publisher in the @publisher.html@ file's script as follows:

  ```[javascript]
    var channelOpts = {
      cipher: {
        key: "AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=="
      }
    };

    /* Create a publisher with channel options */
    var channelName = 'encrypted:messages';
    var channelPub = realtime.channels.get(channelName, channelOpts);

    /* Publish a message with random number when the publish button is clicked */
    var btnPublish = document.getElementById('publish');
    btnPublish.addEventListener('click', function () {
      var message = document.getElementById('message').value;
      channelPub.publish(channelName, message);
    });
  ```

  **What is going on in the code block above?**

  # We define @channelOpts@ object that specifies the cipher key that we intend to use for the encryption. Note that the @cipher key@ should not be a pass-phrase, but a cryptographic key - generated from a secure random source, 128 or 256 bits long, binary or base64-encoded. If you wish to encrypt messages with a pass-phrase (for example, one entered by a user), you should use a "key derivation function":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function to transform that into a key. A sample cipher key is provided here for simplicity. Alternatively, you may use an Ably utility (@Ably.Realtime.Crypto.generateRandomKey()@) to generate a random key.
  # We then obtain a publisher (@channelPub@) instance for publishing messages. Notice how we pass the @channelOpts@ object to @realtime.channels.get()@. This configures @channelPub@ to encrypt the messages before they are published.
  # And lastly, we add a click-listener to the button with id @publish@ to publish the input message to the @'encrypted:messages'@ channel.
  # In the next step we'll see how easy it is to retrieve and decrypt this message

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/encryption-js-step3

blang[nodejs].
  To encrypt our messages, we'll need a cipher key (@SECRET@). Let's add one to our @constants.js@:

  ```[nodejs]
    const SECRET = "AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw==";

    module.exports = {
        API_KEY: API_KEY,
        SECRET: SECRET
    };
  ```
  Note that the @cipher key@ should not be a pass-phrase, but a cryptographic key - generated from a secure random source, 128 or 256 bits long, binary or base64-encoded. If you wish to encrypt messages with a pass-phrase (for example, one entered by a user), you should use a "key derivation function":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function to transform that into a key.
  A sample cipher key is provided here for simplicity. Alternatively, you may use an Ably utility (@Ably.Realtime.Crypto.generateRandomKey()@) to generate a random key.

  Let's now see how we would actually encrypt and publish messages to a channel.

  ```[nodejs]
    const channelOpts = {cipher: {key: constants.SECRET}};
    const pubChannel = realtime.channels.get('encrypted:messages', channelOpts);

    console.log('Publishing encrypted message');

    /* Publish encrypted messages */
    pubChannel.publish('unencrypted', 'an encrypted message');
  ```

  **What is going on in the code block above?**

  # We create @channelOpts@ constant that holds the cipher key that we intend to use for the encryption.
  # We then define (@pubChannel@) for publishing messages. Notice how we pass the @channelOpts@ variable to @realtime.channels.get()@. This configures @pubChannel@ to encrypt each message with the cipher key, before it is published.
  # In the next step, we'll see how easy it is to retrieve and decrypt encrypted messages.

  Let's add an npm script to our @package.json@ to be able to run our publisher code from the terminal:

  ```[json]
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "app:publish": "node ./publisher.js"
    },
    ...
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/encryption-nodejs-step3


h2(#subscribe-messages). Step 4 - Subscribe and decrypt messages

blang[java].
  Now that we've seen how to publish an encrypted message on a channel, let's see to retrieve it in @Subscriber.java@ class.

  ```[java]
  public class Subscriber {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws AblyException {
      AblyRealtime ablyRealtime = new AblyRealtime(API_KEY);
      ChannelOptions options = ChannelOptions.fromCipherKey(CIPHER_KEY_BASE64);
      Channel channel = ablyRealtime.channels.get(CHANNEL_NAME, options);

      channel.subscribe(CHANNEL_NAME, message -> System.out.println("Decrypted data: " + message.data));
    }
  }
  ```

  **What is going on in the code block above?**

  # We then obtain a @Channel@ instance for subscribing to messages. Notice how we pass the @ChannelOptions@ object the same way we did in the previous step.
  # By calling @subscribe()@ on the @channel@, we are all set to receive messages published to the @encrypted:messages" channel. Note since we specified the cipher key in @ChannelOptions@, that the decryption simply works without any additional setup.
  # The lambda passed to @subscribe@ accepts a @message@ object. The @data@ field on @message@ holds the decrypted content, which we're printing out on the standard output.

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/encryption-java-step-4


blang[javascript].
  Now that we have seen how to publish an encrypted message to a channel, let's see how we can retrieve it.
  Let's create a @subscriber.html@ with a textarea to display received messages, as shown below:

  ```[html]
    <html lang="en">
    <body>
    <h1>Subscribe (and Decrypt) Messages</h1>
    <br><br>
    <label for="subscriptions">Your subscriptions will appear here:</label>
    <textarea id="subscriptions" style="width: 100%" rows="15"></textarea>
    </body>

    <!-- Include the latest Ably Library  -->
    <script src="https://cdn.ably.com/lib/ably.min-1.js"></script>

    <!-- instantiate the Ably library  -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var realtime = new Ably.Realtime('INSERT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE');
        var channelName = 'encrypted:messages';

        /* Create options object with cipher(encryption) configuration */
        /* Note: A sample cipher key is provided here for simplicity. Alternatively, one could use
        the Ably.Realtime.Crypto.generateRandomKey() utility method to generate a valid key */
        var channelOpts = {
            cipher: {
                key: "AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=="
            }
        };

        /* Create a subscriber with channel options */
        var channelSub = realtime.channels.get(channelName, channelOpts);

        var textAreaSubscriptions = document.getElementById('subscriptions');
        /* Subscribe to messages from an encrypted channel */
        channelSub.subscribe(function (message) {
            var timestamp = new Date(message.timestamp).toLocaleString();
            textAreaSubscriptions.value += '[' + timestamp + '] ' + message.data + '\n';
        });
    </script>
    </html>
  ```

  **What is going on in the code block above?**

  # We get a reference to the @subscriptions@ textbox and initialize it's value to 'Retrieving encrypted messages from channel...'
  # We then obtain a @channelSub@ instance. You may have already noticed that it instantiated the same way we instantiated our publisher in Step 3.
  # All we're doing here is calling the @channelSub.subscribe()@ and passing it a callback function that appends each received message to the textbox's value. We also append a human readable timestamp to each message to tell similar message received at different instants apart.
  # Notice, how easily we enabled the decryption mechanism simply by using a @channelOpts@ containing our cipher key.

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/encryption-js-step4

blang[nodejs].
  Now that we have seen how to publish an encrypted message to a channel, let's see how we can retrieve it.
  For this purpose, let's create a @subscriber.js@, with following :

  ```[nodejs]
    const Ably = require('ably');
    const constants = require('./constants');

    /* instantiate the Ably library */
    const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({key: constants.API_KEY});
    const channelOpts = {cipher: {key: constants.SECRET}};
    const subChannel = realtime.channels.get('encrypted:messages', channelOpts);

    console.log('Retrieving encrypted message');

    /* Subscribe to messages */
    subChannel.subscribe(console.log);
  ```

  **What is going on in the code block above?**

  # We obtain a @subChannel@ instance very similar to how we did for @pubChannel@.
  # The only difference being, in this instance we'll subscribe to the channel instead of publishing to it, using the @Channel.subscribe()@
  # For simplicity, we're passing a @console.log@ to the subscribe() to log each received message.
  # In a real-world project, you would do more than just log the incoming message, and can define a more appropriate callback per your requirements.
  # But notice how easily we enabled the decryption mechanism, merely by specifying a @channelOpts@ containing our cipher key, during our channel instantiation.

  Let's add one more npm script to our @package.json@ to be able to run our subscriber code from the terminal:

  ```[json]
    "scripts": {
        "app:publish": "node ./publisher.js",
        "app:subscribe": "node ./subscriber.js"
    },
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/encryption-nodejs-step4

We're done, it's that simple. We have now shown you how to install Ably, then we published an encrypted message on a channel, and later retrieved it using the encryption API.
