The Logs section in your Ably dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities through detailed event logging across all aspects of your application. This interface enables you to track system activities, troubleshoot issues, and analyze patterns across API requests, channels, connections, integrations, and push notifications.

## Log sections overview

The logs interface is organized into five specialized sections, each focused on different aspects of your Ably implementation:

| Log section | Purpose | Key use cases |
|---|---|---|
| API requests | Monitor REST API calls and authentication attempts | Debug API integration issues and track request patterns |
| Channels | Track channel events and activities | Monitor channel lifecycle and message flow |
| Connections | Monitor client connection events | Troubleshoot connection issues and track client behavior |
| Integration errors | Track integration failures and webhook issues | Debug external service integrations and data flow |
| Push notifications | Monitor push notification delivery and errors | Troubleshoot notification delivery issues |

Each section provides date range filtering and specialized search capabilities tailored to the specific type of events being monitored.
