Security and encryption are front of mind and any realtime platform will have robust security built into their design and delivery. A good general checklist for security is:

* TLS connection to ensure all "data in transit are encrypted":https://faqs.ably.com/are-messages-sent-to-and-received-from-ably-securely-using-tls
* "Token-based authentication":/auth/token?utm_source={{COMPANY_ID_0}}_v_{{COMPANY_ID_1}}&utm_medium=compare_pages (including "JWT":https://jwt.io support), which ensures your private key is never shared and instead a short-lived token is used to authenticate
* Configurable "private key permissions":https://faqs.ably.com/setting-up-and-managing-api-keys to restrict "channels/topics":/general/channel-rules-namespaces or operations
* "Encrypted message payloads":https://faqs.ably.com/cross-platform-symmetric-encryption-offered-by-the-libraries to enhance security and privacy of all messages
