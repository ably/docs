The Chat section in your Ably dashboard provides a centralized hub for managing realtime messaging and user interactions across your chat application. Access the [Chat dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/chat) to monitor and manage your chat rooms. From this overview page, you can quickly access getting started guides for different platforms, explore ready-to-use examples, and review recent product updates through the changelog.

The dashboard makes it easy to jump into room monitoring, review implementation patterns, and stay updated with the latest Chat features and fixes.

## Rooms <a id="rooms"/>

The rooms interface serves as your primary dashboard for monitoring and managing all chat messaging activity across your application. This section provides realtime visibility into room performance, user connections, and message flow, enabling you to quickly identify issues and optimize your chat implementation.

Navigate to the rooms section through the dashboard sidebar under Products > Chat > Rooms. The main rooms view displays all active rooms in a clean, searchable interface that makes it easy to monitor your entire chat infrastructure at a glance.

### Room browser functionality <a id="room-browser"/>

The room finder search box allows you to quickly locate specific rooms by name - essential when managing applications with numerous rooms across different features or namespaces. Simply enter a room name or partial match to filter the results and find the rooms you need to inspect.

The interface shows exactly how many rooms are currently active with a counter display, giving you immediate awareness of your application's chat scope and helping you track room growth over time.

Each room entry in the list displays key information for rapid assessment:

| Column | Information displayed | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Room name | The full identifier for the chat room | Identify specific rooms and namespaces |
| User count | Real-time number of users currently connected | Monitor activity patterns and detect issues |
| Inspect button | Eye icon for detailed room access | Access advanced monitoring and configuration |

The user count column is particularly valuable for identifying rooms experiencing high activity, unusual participation patterns, or potential connection issues. Rooms with unexpectedly high or low user counts can indicate performance problems, client-side issues, or changes in user behavior that need investigation.

## Room inspection <a id="inspection"/>

When you click the inspect button (eye icon) next to any room in the rooms list, you access a comprehensive room monitoring interface that provides deep visibility into that specific room's behavior, performance, and configuration.

### Room inspection overview <a id="inspection-overview"/>

The inspection page opens with a detailed overview showing critical room information and realtime metrics. The header displays the full room name with a copy button for easy reference, along with breadcrumb navigation back to the main rooms list.

#### Live analytics and visualization

The inspection interface provides two primary analytics sections with live, updating charts that help you understand room behavior over time.

##### Messages analytics

The messages chart displays realtime inbound and outbound message flow with color-coded tracking for different message types. Use this to identify message patterns and delivery bottlenecks.

##### Occupancy analytics

The occupancy chart tracks connections, participants, and presence members over time. Use this data to understand user engagement patterns and optimize your chat architecture.

#### Room configuration and rules

The rules section provides comprehensive configuration options for controlling room behavior and security requirements. You can configure three categories of rules:

| Rule category | Configuration options | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Storage rules | Persist last message, persist all messages | Control message persistence and history retention |
| Room rules | Identification required, TLS required | Enforce security requirements |
| Feature rules | Push notifications, message annotations/updates/deletes | Enable advanced capabilities |

#### Integrations

The integrations section allows you to connect rooms to external services and configure automated workflows triggered by room activity.
