# Error 50010: Internal server error

## What Happened

Ably's infrastructure encountered an internal error while processing your request. This typically occurs when edge proxy services or resource allocation systems experience unexpected issues.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 50010 | 500/501 | Server Error (Infrastructure) | Yes - temporary infrastructure issue |

## Quick Fix

- SDKs automatically retry this error with appropriate backoff
- Check [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) if persistent
- No immediate action required unless error persists beyond 2 minutes

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Ably's edge proxy service has encountered an unknown internal error whilst processing the request"
- "Unable to place instance compatible with constraints"
- "Client application:{id} unavailable timer expired"
- "Client channel:{id} unavailable timer expired"
- "Client account:{id} unavailable timer expired"

## Common Causes

1. **Edge proxy issues** (60% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50010-analysis.md lines 13-21 -->
   - CloudFront encounters unrecognized error status
   - Network routing problems between edge and origin
   - Temporary edge server overload

2. **Resource allocation failures** (30% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50010-analysis.md lines 23-33 -->
   - Cluster cannot find nodes matching placement constraints
   - Resource initialization timeout exceeded
   - Insufficient capacity in specific regions

3. **Infrastructure instability** (10% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50010-knowledge.md lines 28-30 -->
   - Ring stability problems in distributed system
   - Core process issues requiring recovery
   - Cascading failures during high load

## Resolution Steps

1. **For transient errors (most cases)**
   - Ably SDKs automatically retry with exponential backoff
   - No action required - connection will recover automatically
   - Monitor your application logs for resolution confirmation

2. **For persistent errors (>2 minutes)**
   <!-- Source: Recovery guidance from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50010-knowledge.md lines 9-12 -->
   - Check https://status.ably.com for any ongoing incidents
   - Review recent changes to your implementation
   - Note the exact error message and timing

3. **If affecting critical operations**
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Consider temporary fallback mechanisms
   - Collect diagnostic information for support

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically handle this error by:
- Retrying with exponential backoff (starting at 1 second)
- Attempting connection to alternative datacenters
- Preserving message queue during recovery
- Restoring channel attachments after reconnection

The SDK will continue retry attempts until the connection is restored or enters a terminal state after extended failure.

## Prevention

While this is primarily an infrastructure error, you can minimize impact by:
- Using multiple Ably apps across different regions for critical services
- Implementing proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Monitoring connection state changes in your application
- Setting appropriate timeout values for critical operations
