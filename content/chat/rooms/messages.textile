Send, update, delete, and receive messages in a chat room with any number of participants. Users subscribe to messages by registering a listener, and send messages to all users that are subscribed to receive them.
A user can also update or delete a message, all users that are subscribed to the room will be notified of the changes.

h2(#subscribe). Subscribe to messages

blang[javascript].
  Subscribe to receive messages in a room by registering a listener. Use the "@messages.subscribe()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Messages.html#subscribe method in a room to receive all messages that are sent to it:

blang[react].
    Subscribe to messages with the "@useMessages@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/functions/chat-react.useMessages.html hook. Supply a listener and the hook will automatically subscribe to messages sent to the room. As long as a defined value is provided, the subscription will persist across renders. If the listener value is undefined, the subscription will be removed until it becomes defined again.

    Providing a listener will also enable you to retrieve messages that have been "previously sent to the room.":/chat/rooms/history

```[javascript]
const {unsubscribe} = room.messages.subscribe((message) => {
  console.log(message);
});
```

```[react]
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useMessages } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  useMessages({
    listener: (message) => {
      console.log('Received message: ', message);
    },
  });

  return <div>...</div>;
};
```

h3(#structure). Message structure

The following is the structure of a message:

```[javascript]
{
  "serial": "01826232498871-001@abcdefghij:001",
  "clientId": "basketLover014",
  "roomId": "basketball-stream",
  "text": "What a shot!",
  "headers": {},
  "metadata": {},
  "createdAt": new Date("2024-06-12T11:37:59.988Z"),
  "action": "message.create",
  "version": "01826232498871-001@abcdefghij:001",
  "timestamp": new Date("2024-06-12T11:37:59.988Z"),
  "operation": {},
}
```

The following are the properties of a message:

|_. Property |_. Description |_. Type |
| serial | An Ably-generated ID used to uniquely identify the message. By comparing it to others it provides a deterministic global ordering of messages. | String |
| clientId | The client identifier of the user that created the message. | String |
| roomId | The name of the room the message was created in. | String |
| text | The message contents. | String |
| headers | Optional headers for adding additional information to a message, such as the relative timestamp of a livestream video, or flagging a message as important. Do not use the headers for authoritative information. There is no server-side validation. When reading headers treat them like user input. | Object |
| metadata | Optional additional metadata about the message, such as animations, effects or links to other resources such as images. This information is not read by Ably. Do not use metadata for authoritative information. There is no server-side validation. When reading metadata treat it like user input. | Object |
| createdAt | The time the message was created. | Date |
| action | The latest action performed on this message, such as <code>message.create</code>, <code>message.update</code> or <code>message.delete</code>.  | String |
| version | An Ably-generated ID used to uniquely identify the version of the message. It provides a deterministic global ordering of message versions. The <code>version</code> is identical to <code>serial</code> if the action is <code>message.create</code>.  | String |
| timestamp | The time the action was performed. It will be identical to <code>createdAt</code> if the action is a <code>message.create</code>. | Date |
| operation | For updates and deletions, this provides additional details about the action. It may contain the following properties: | Object or undefined |
| | clientId: The client identifier of the user associated with the action. | String or undefined |
| | description: Optional description for the action. | String or undefined |
| | metadata: Optional additional metadata about the action. | Object or undefined |

<aside data-type="note">
<p>Both <code>serial</code> and <code>version</code> are lexicographically sortable strings. This means they can be used to enforce a deterministic global ordering based on string comparison.</p>
 <p><strong>Global Ordering Rules:</strong></p>
  <p>For message <code>serial</code>: If the <code>serial</code> of one message occurs before another when lexicographically sorted, the first message is considered to have occurred globally before the other. If the <code>serial</code> values are identical, the two messages are considered to be the same message.</p>
  <p>For <code>version</code>: When two messages share the same <code>serial</code>, their respective <code>version</code> values can be used to determine the order of actions applied to the message.</p>
  <p>An action (such as an update) with a <code>version</code> is considered to have occurred before some other action, if the first action's <code>version</code> occurs before another when sorted lexicographically. If the <code>version</code> values are identical, the actions are considered to be the same.</p>
</aside>

h3(#unsubscribe). Unsubscribe from messages

blang[javascript].
  Unsubscribe from messages to remove previously registered listeners.

  Use the "@unsubscribe()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.MessageSubscriptionResponse.html#unsubscribe function returned in the @subscribe()@ response to remove a listener:

  ```[javascript]
  // Initial subscription
  const { unsubscribe } = room.messages.subscribe((message) => console.log(message));

  // To remove the listener
  unsubscribe();
  ```

  Use the "@messages.unsubscribeAll()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Messages.html#unsubscribeAll method to deregister all chat message listeners in a room:

  ```[javascript]
  await room.messages.unsubscribeAll();
  ```

  <aside data-type='note'>
  <p>There is a difference between unsubscribing from messages and detaching from a room that is important to understand. </p>
  <p>Messages are sent to users as soon as they "attach":/chat/rooms#attach to a room, irrespective of whether a listener has been registered by calling @subscribe()@. Calling @unsubscribe()@ only deregisters the listener.</p>
  <p>The "@detach()@":/chat/rooms#detach method detaches a user from the room. At that point a user will no longer receive any messages that are sent to the room.</p>
  </aside>

blang[react].
  When you unmount the component that is using the @useMessages@ hook, it will automatically handle unsubscribing any associated listeners registered to receive messages.

h2(#send). Send a message

blang[javascript].
  Use the "@messages.send()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Messages.html#send method to send a message in a chat room. All users that are "subscribed":#subscribe to messages on that room will receive it:

blang[react].
  Use the "@send()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-react.UseMessagesResponse.html#send method available from the response of the @useMessages@ hook to to send a message to the room:

```[javascript]
await room.messages.send({text: 'hello'});
```

```[react]
import { useMessages } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { send } = useMessages();

  const handleMessageSend = () => {
    send({ text: 'Hello, World!' });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleMessageSend}>Send Message</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

h2(#update). Update a message

blang[javascript].
  Use the "@messages.update()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_js.Messages.html#update method to update a message in a chat room. All users that are "subscribed":#subscribe to messages on that room will receive the update:

blang[react].
  Use the "@update()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_react.UseMessagesResponse.html#update method available from the response of the @useMessages@ hook to update a message in the room:

```[javascript]
import { Message } from '@ably/chat';
const messageToUpdate: Message
await room.messages.update(messageToUpdate, { text: "my updated text" }, { description: "Message update by user" });
```

```[react]
import { useMessages } from '@ably/chat/react';
import { Message } from '@ably/chat';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { update } = useMessages();
  const [message, setMessage] = useState<Message>();

  const handleMessageUpdate = (msg: Message) => {
    update(msg, { text: "my updated text" }, { description: "Message update by user" })
    .then((updatedMsg: Message) => {
    console.log('Message updated:', updatedMsg);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error updating message: ', error);
    });
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => handleMessageUpdate(message)}>Update Message</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

h3(#filter-updates). Filter for updates

blang[javascript].
  Use the "@messages.subscribe()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_js.Messages.html#subscribe method to receive messages in a room. To filter for updated messages, provide a listener that checks the @type@ property of the message event:

blang[react].
  Use the "@useMessages@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/functions/chat_react.useMessages.html hook to subscribe to messages in a room. To filter for updated messages, provide a listener that checks the @type@ property of the message event:

  switch (event.type) {
    case MessageEvents.Created:
      console.log('Received message: ', event.message);
      break;
    case MessageEvents.Updated:
      console.log('Message updated: ', event.message);
      break;
    default:
      break;

          break;
      }
    },
  });

  return <div>...</div>;
