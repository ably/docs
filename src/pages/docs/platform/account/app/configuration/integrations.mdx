The Integrations section in your Ably dashboard provides centralized management for connecting your Ably application with external services and systems. This interface enables you to configure webhooks, set up data streaming, and manage third-party integrations to extend your application's functionality.

## Integration Rules <a id="integration-rules"/>

Integration Rules enable you to configure how your Ably data flows to external systems and services.

### Webhooks and serverless functions <a id="webhooks-serverless"/>

Webhooks allow your serverless functions or your own servers to be invoked following any events on Ably. Ably Queues provide a scalable way to consume realtime data from your servers. Firehose allows you to stream your data into 3rd party systems such as Kinesis or Kafka.

### Integration capabilities <a id="integration-capabilities"/>

| Integration type | Description | Use cases |
|---|---|---|
| Webhooks | Trigger serverless functions or custom servers on Ably events | Event-driven processing, notifications, custom business logic |
| Ably Queues | Scalable realtime data consumption | Message processing, data pipelines, server-side handling |
| Firehose | Stream data to external systems | Analytics, data warehousing, integration with Kinesis or Kafka |

### Permission requirements <a id="permission-requirements"/>

Integration Rules require admin-level permissions to create or edit. If you see a permission message, please contact the account owner to assign admin privileges to your user account.

## Incoming Webhooks Setup <a id="incoming-webhooks"/>

Incoming webhooks provide a way to publish data into Ably from external sources and systems.

### Incoming webhook functionality <a id="webhook-functionality"/>

Incoming webhooks are used to publish data into Ably. The generated URL can be used in code or to connect other 3rd party systems to scale out publishing of events.

### Configuration requirements <a id="configuration-requirements"/>

Similar to Integration Rules, Incoming Webhooks require admin permissions to create or edit. Contact your account owner if you need access to configure incoming webhooks.

### Current webhook status <a id="webhook-status"/>

The interface displays the current status of your webhook configurations. If no webhooks are currently configured, you'll see a status message indicating this.

## Active integrations <a id="active-integrations"/>

The integrations dashboard displays any currently active integrations and their status.

### Integration management <a id="integration-management"/>

| Integration feature | Description | Available actions |
|---|---|---|
| Integration status | Shows connection state and health | Monitor integration performance |
| Dashboard access | Direct links to external service dashboards | Quick access to integrated services |
| Integration controls | Options to modify or remove integrations | Manage integration lifecycle |

### Example integration: Datadog <a id="datadog-integration"/>

The interface shows sample integration configurations, such as:

### Integration details <a id="integration-details"/>

| Integration | Status | Purpose | Functionality | Management |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Datadog | Connected | Increase visibility into application performance | Stream realtime application metrics from Ably into your Datadog dashboard to monitor messages, channels, and connections in use | Dashboard access and removal options |
