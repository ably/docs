Ably AI Transport is a solution for building stateful, steerable, multi-device AI experiences into new or existing applications. You can use AI Transport as the transport layer with any LLM or agent framework, without rebuilding your existing stack.

## Key features

AI Transport builds on [Ably Pub/Sub](/docs/basics) to enable reliable interactive AI experiences at scale and provides the following key features:

### Reliable, resumable token streams <a id="reliable-tokens"/>

Ably AI Transport enables you to [stream tokens](/docs/ai-transport/features/token-streaming) reliably from your AI agent to your client devices. The token stream survives reconnections thanks to Ably's [connection recovery](/docs/platform/architecture/connection-recovery) capabilities, so your clients don't miss anything. If the user has multiple devices or tabs then the stream history stays in sync across all of them, with no additional work from your application, and a new client can quickly catch up on both past responses and the current in-progress response.

### Messaging patterns <a id="messages"/>

Truly interactive AI experiences require more than a simple HTTP request-response exchange between a single client and agent. AI transport allows the use of different [messaging patterns](/docs/ai-transport/features/messaging), for example:
* A user can communicate with multiple agents in a single channel and receive their responses simultaneously, along with any references or citations the model may supply.
* A user can send additional requests or redirections while a response is in progress, instead of waiting until the response is complete.
* Human-in-the-loop interactions, such as requests for tool call permissions or further information, can be easily implemented and form part of the conversation history for future reference.
* A new participant joining the conversation, for example a customer support representative, can see the full chat history without asking the user to repeat information.

### Session management <a id="session"/>

With AI Transport, communication between the client and agent is not tied to the connection state of either party. This gives you much more control over how to manage [session lifetime](/docs/ai-transport/features/session-management) and opens up opportunities for improved user experience, for example sending [push notifications](/docs/push) to offline users when a long-running task completes.

### Enterprise controls <a id="enterprise"/>

Ably's platform provides [integrations](/docs/platform/integrations) and capabilities to ensure that your application will meet the requirements of enterprise environments, for example [message auditing](/docs/platform/integrations/streaming), [client identification](/docs/auth/identified-clients) and [RBAC capabilities](/docs/auth/capabilities).

## Pricing

We are working on an updated pricing model for AI Transport, so watch this space! The current Ably Pub/Sub [pricing model](/docs/platform/pricing) will apply until then, but please [contact us](/contact) if this will not meet your needs.
