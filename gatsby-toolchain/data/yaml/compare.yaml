            *Yes.*<br/><br/>Ably's pricing is simple and transparent. You pay for the messages, peak active channels and peak connections you use for the month. You can either pay for what you've used at the end of the month, or reserve capacity in advance each month and benefit from a discount.
          pubnub: >
            *It’s complex.* <br/><br/>PubNub follows a usage-based pricing model. However, pricing is based on over 60 different transaction types, making it difficult to predict ongoing costs. <br/><br/> _(source "CL3":https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrFOBNhk5R5ttv-w5wVSU9EfCjqpVJaKDTaNgdta_l0/edit#heading=h.3mwvyxb4qjw)_

            *No.*<br/><br/>Pusher packages are priced in tiers. If you were on a Pro package at $99 with 2k connections and 4m messages, and you later needed 3k connections but the same number of messages, you would have to upgrade to the Business package at $299 (3x the price). With Ably, you'd just pay for an additional 1k connections.

          Unfortunately at Ably we've been laser focussed on building the most robust and scalable realtime platform on the planet.
          As such, we haven't yet had time to schedule the creation of a theme tune into an engineering sprint.
          <br/>PubNub clearly wins on this front!<br/>
