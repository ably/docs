title: Typing indicators
meta_description: "Display typing indicators in a room so that users can see when someone else is writing a message."
---

Typing indicators enable you to display which users are currently writing a message in a room. This feature can be used to display a message such as *Sandi is typing...*, or when a certain threshold is reached you could instead display *Multiple people are typing...* or *12 people are typing...*. Typing events are emitted whenever a user starts or stops typing.

## Subscribe to typing events <a id="subscribe"/>

<If lang="javascript,swift,kotlin,jetpack">
Subscribe to typing events by registering a listener. Typing events can be emitted when a user starts typing, and when they stop typing. Use the <If lang="javascript">[`typing.subscribe()`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Typing.html#subscribe)</If><If lang="swift">[`typing.subscribe()`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-swift/main/AblyChat/documentation/ablychat/typing/subscribe%28%29-7uox7)</If><If lang="kotlin">[`typing.subscribe()`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-kotlin/main/dokka/chat/com.ably.chat/-typing/subscribe.html)</If><If lang="jetpack">[`collectAsCurrentlyTyping()`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-kotlin/main/jetpack/chat-extensions-compose/com.ably.chat.extensions.compose/collect-as-currently-typing.html)</If> method in a room to receive these updates:
</If>

<If lang="react">
Subscribe to typing events with the [`useTyping`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/functions/chat-react.useTyping.html) hook. Supply an optional listener to receive the typing events, or use the [`currentlyTyping`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-react.UseTypingResponse.html#currentlyTyping) property returned by the hook to access the list of those users that are currently typing.
</If>

<Code>
```javascript
const {unsubscribe} = room.typing.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log("Currently typing: ", event.currentlyTyping);
});
```

```react
import { useTyping } from '@ably/chat/react';
import { TypingSetEvent } from '@ably/chat';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { currentlyTyping, roomError } = useTyping({
    listener: (typingEvent: TypingSetEvent) => {
      console.log('Typing event received: ', typingEvent);
    },
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {roomError && <p>Typing Error: {roomError.message}</p>}
      <p>Currently typing: {Array.from(currentlyTyping).join(', ')}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```swift
let typingSubscription = room.typing.subscribe()
for await typing in typingSubscription {
  typingInfo = typing.currentlyTyping.isEmpty ? "" :
                "Typing: \(typing.currentlyTyping.joined(separator: ", "))..."
}
```

```kotlin
val subscription = room.typing.subscribe { event: TypingSetEvent ->
    println("currently typing: ${event.currentlyTyping}")
}
```

```jetpack
import androidx.compose.material.*
import androidx.compose.runtime.*
import com.ably.chat.Room
import com.ably.chat.extensions.compose.collectAsCurrentlyTyping

@Composable
fun TypingComponent(room: Room) {
  val currentlyTyping by room.collectAsCurrentlyTyping()

  Text("Currently typing: ${currentlyTyping.joinToString(", ")}")
}
```
</Code>

### Typing event structure <a id="structure"/>

The following is the structure of a typing event:

<Code>
```json
{
  "type": "typing.set.changed",
  "currentlyTyping": {
    "clemons",
    "zoranges",
  },
  "change": {
    "type": "typing.started",
    "clientId": "clemons"
  }
}
```
</Code>

The following are the properties of a typing event:

| Property | Description | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| type | The type of the event. | String |
| currentlyTyping | A set of all users currently typing. | Set |
| change | The single change that resulted in the event. | Object |
| | `type`: The type of change that occurred. | String |
| | `clientId`: The `clientId` of the user that triggered the change. | String |

You can use the size of the `currentlyTyping` set to decide whether to display individual user names, or that multiple people are typing in your user interface.

### Unsubscribe from typing events <a id="unsubscribe"/>

<If lang="javascript,kotlin">
Use the `unsubscribe()` function returned in the `subscribe()` response to remove a typing listener:
</If>

<If lang="jetpack">
Jetpack Compose automatically handles lifecycle and cleanup when using `collectAsCurrentlyTyping()`.
</If>

<If lang="swift">
You don't need to handle removing listeners, as this is done automatically by the SDK.
</If>

<If lang="react">
When you unmount the component that is using the `useTyping` hook, it will automatically handle unsubscribing any associated listeners registered for typing events.
</If>

<If lang="javascript,kotlin">
<Code>
```javascript
// Initial subscription
import { TypingSetEvent } from '@ably/chat';
const { unsubscribe } = room.typing.subscribe((event: TypingSetEvent) => {
  console.log('Typing event received: ', event);
});

// To remove the listener
unsubscribe();
```

```kotlin
// Initial subscription
val (unsubscribe) = room.typing.subscribe { event ->
  println("Typing event received: $event")
}

// To remove the listener
unsubscribe()
```
</Code>

  Button(onClick = {
    coroutineScope.launch {
      room.typing.stop()
    }
  }) {
    Text("Stop Typing")
  }
}
```
</Code>

### Typing Event Frequency <a id="frequency"/>

The Typing feature includes a configurable timer that controls how often typing events are sent to the server. This timer is reset each time a new typing event is sent, it works as follows:
* On the **first call** to `keystroke()`, the timer is set and an event is sent to the server.
* **Subsequent calls** before the timer expires result in a no-op.
* After the timer expires, a new typing event is sent and the timer is reset.
* If `stop()` is called, the timer is reset and a `typing.stopped` event is sent to the server.

You can configure the length of this timer using the `heartbeatThrottleMs` parameter in `RoomOptions` (default: **10,000ms**).
It is recommended that you call `keystroke()` with every keypress, and the SDK will handle when and if to send a typing indicator to the server.

### Emulating User Behavior <a id="emulating-heartbeats"/>

You can emulate user behavior (e.g., in chatbots) by setting a timeout to call `keystroke()` at intervals equal to the `heartbeatThrottleMs` plus a small delay, e.g. 200ms. This will ensure the typing indicator remains active.

### Grace Period for Typing Events <a id="grace-period"/>

For the recipient of typing events:
* The typing indicator remains active for the **duration** defined by the `heartbeatThrottleMs` parameter, plus a predefined **2000ms grace period**.
* Receiving a new typing event before the grace period ends will reset the timeout.
* If the grace period ends without receiving a new typing event, the SDK will emit a `typing.stopped` event for that client to any subscribed listeners.

**For example:** With the `heartbeatThrottleMs` set to **10,000ms**, the typing indicator remains active for **12,000ms**. If no new typing event is received within this time, the SDK will emit a `typing.stopped` event.

### Adjusting the Event Frequency <a id="adjusting-timeout"/>

You can adjust the `heartbeatThrottleMs` parameter to balance responsiveness and resource costs:
* **Increase responsiveness**: Lower the value → More typing events are sent to the server → Higher cost as more messages are sent.
* **Save resource costs**: Raise the value → Fewer typing events are sent to the server → Lower responsiveness, but less cost as fewer messages are sent overall.

This balance allows you to optimize cost and responsiveness based on your applications needs.

<Aside data-type='note'>
All clients in a room must have the same timeout value configured. If not, typing indicators might not display correctly.
