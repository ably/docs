<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_introduction') %>

h2(#reliability). Is it globally fast, reliable, and redundant?

<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_reliability') %>

compare_table(Reliability).

h2(#interoperability). What’s the level of platform interoperability?

<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_interoperability') %>

compare_table(Interoperability).

h2(#starting). How easy is it to get started and scale up?

<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_starting') %>

h4(#ease). Is the API easy to use?

Looking at the official Node.js Client, this section compares ease of publishing.

<%= partial partial_version('compare/ease/_realtime') %>

<%= partial partial_version('compare/ease/_push-technology') %>

h5(#ease-best). Which API is best?

Both Realtime.co and Push Technology APIs are easy to use. They’re simple and self-explanatory, getting you up and running in a relatively short time.

h2(#documenting). Is the documentation any good?

<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_documentation') %>

So how do "Realtime.co":https://framework.realtime.co/messaging/#documentation and "Push Technology":https://www.pushtechnology.com/developers/ stack up? Both do quite well with fairly extensive documentation across quickstart guides, SDKs, and docs explaining some of the core features of their respective platforms such as ‘presence’ and ‘topics’. That said, Push Technology has the edge with clearer, more current, and a wider variety of documentation.

*NOTE: at the time of writing (the end of {{PUBLISHED_DATE}}) it looks as if the Realtime.co documentation is quite out of date, with the most recent update on January 2nd 2018. This is a red flag because it suggests the product is no longer in active development or being maintained. In contrast, Push Technology’s last update was January 10th 2019. That’s over a year’s difference.*

h2(#connectivity). Connectivity and transport

<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_connectivity') %>

Both Realtime.co and Push Technology support the full range of transports.

h2(#features). How mature is the feature set?

<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_features') %>

compare_table(Features, Why does it matter?).

As the matrix shows, both platforms offer a good level of realtime messaging functionality. But they also offer some additional help for developers when it comes to doing the technical heavy lifting. However, both could offer more on that front as features like serverless functions, reliable message ordering, and message queues are missing. With serverless compute, functions, and event-driven architecture becoming more integrated into our software design these omissions should weigh heavily in your decision.

While on the surface it may look as if Push Technology has fewer features than Realtime.co, they both offer similar functionality. And one could argue that those features Realtime.co does offer that Push Technology doesn’t aren’t in the best of shape.

That said, each clearly has different offerings with their own strengths and weaknesses. So, as stated before, using this feature matrix as a guide, check the platform functionality in relation to your own specific requirements.

h2(#management). Does the platform offer realtime API Management tools?

<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_api_tools') %>

h2(#security). How secure is the platform and the way it does things?

<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_security') %>

<%= partial partial_version('compare/security/_realtime') %>

<%= partial partial_version('compare/security/_push-technology') %>

h2(#support). How responsive and helpful is support?

<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_support') %>

<%= partial partial_version('compare/support/_realtime') %>

<%= partial partial_version('compare/support/_push-technology') %>

We can’t comment on the access to engineers for deeply technical support. It’s also worth noting it looks like there’s only a single person manning the live chat.

When it comes to support, Push Technology is the clear winner.

h2(#pricing). How clear, flexible, and scalable is the pricing structure?

<%= partial partial_version('compare/intros/_pricing') %>

Both Realtime.co and Push Technology offer free and paid versions.

<%= partial partial_version('compare/pricing/_realtime_value') %>

<%= partial partial_version('compare/pricing/_push-technology_value') %>

h2(#who-uses). Who’s behind the platforms?

It’s good to know who’s behind a company when you’re relying on them for such an essential service. Do they have a proven track record? Will they be around next year? These are all valid concerns. We’ve tried to answer these questions with information from each platform’s website.

h4. How long have they been around?

Push Technology was founded in 2006 while Realtime.co was established in 2014.

h4. Team size

According to Crunchbase, "Realtime.co":https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/realtime-co has 51-100 employees and "Push Technology":https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/push-technology has 11-50 employees. It’s worth noting that Realtime.co is actually a product named Realtime Framework produced by Realtime.co app creators.

h4. Track record

Both Realtime.co and Push Technology both have a range of brands using their platforms, including:

|_. Products |_. Realtime.co |_. Push |
| | League Of War: Mercenaries | Brenock Technology (Ocean Guardian) |
| | Buddytruk | PIA First |
| | The Fluid App | Tradition |
| | Mastercook | Sportingbet |
| | Brandlive | Consorsbank |

h2(#best). Which platform is best?

Unfortunately this just isn’t a question we can answer outright. Both of these realtime data streaming platforms have their pros and cons when it comes to functionality. However, on the strength of docs, level of support, and outward strength of the core product Push Technology is likely to be the better choice of the two.

And, as we’ve mentioned twice before, as of January 2019 it’s unclear whether Realtime.co is still actively building or even maintaining their product. So please do your own research before choosing any provider.

Ultimately the choice is yours but hopefully this article helped you gain a better understanding of what you should look for in a "realtime data streaming platform":https://www.ably.io - and whether Realtime.co or Pusher Technology can provide what you’re looking for.
