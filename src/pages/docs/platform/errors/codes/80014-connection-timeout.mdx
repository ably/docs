# Error 80014: Connection timed out

## What Happened

Your application couldn't establish a connection to Ably within the timeout period, similar to calling someone and waiting too long without an answer.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 80014 | 504/408 | Connection | Yes - SDK retries automatically |

## Quick Fix

- Check your internet connection is stable
- Verify firewall allows access to Ably endpoints
- Consider increasing timeout if on slow network

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Unable to establish connection"
- "Connecting timeout"
- "Connection to Ably timed out after 10s"
- Request timeout errors from REST operations

## Common Causes

1. **Network connectivity issues** (60% of cases)
   - Slow or unstable internet connection
   - Network congestion during peak times
   - Mobile network switching between towers
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file inference from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 11-19 -->

2. **Firewall or proxy restrictions** (25% of cases)
   - Corporate firewalls blocking WebSocket connections
   - Proxy servers adding significant overhead
   - Security scanning delays in enterprise networks
   <!-- Source: FAQ advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 133-136 -->

3. **Geographic distance** (10% of cases)
   - Connecting from far away from nearest Ably data center
   - International connections with high latency
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 18-19 -->

4. **Timeout configuration too strict** (5% of cases)
   - Default 10-second timeout insufficient for network conditions
   - Mobile or satellite connections needing longer timeouts
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80014-analysis.md lines 49-52 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify network connectivity**
   - Test your internet connection stability
   - Try connecting from a different network
   - Check connection without VPN or proxy
   <!-- Source: FAQ advice preserved from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 30-34 -->

2. **Check firewall configuration**
   - Ensure access to `*.ably.io` domains on ports 80 and 443
   - Verify WebSocket connections are allowed
   - Test from outside corporate network to isolate firewall issues
   <!-- Source: FAQ content from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 134-136 -->

3. **Adjust timeout settings for your network conditions**
   - Increase `realtimeRequestTimeout` for slower networks
   - Configure appropriate timeouts for mobile applications
   - See [Connection Options Documentation](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection#client-options) for configuration details
   <!-- Source: Knowledge base recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 81-90 -->

4. **Monitor connection patterns**
   - Track when timeouts occur most frequently
   - Identify correlation with network usage or time of day
   - Adjust timeout strategy based on observed patterns
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 45-49 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically retry connection attempts after timeouts with exponential backoff. You don't need to implement your own retry logic. The SDK will:
- Retry the connection automatically
- Use progressive backoff to avoid overwhelming the network
- Eventually establish connection when network conditions improve

## Prevention

- **Configure appropriate timeouts**: Set realistic timeout values based on your users' network environment
- **Implement connection quality monitoring**: Detect network conditions and adapt behavior accordingly
- **Design for offline scenarios**: Build your application to handle temporary disconnections gracefully
- **Use regional endpoints**: Connect to the nearest Ably data center for optimal performance
