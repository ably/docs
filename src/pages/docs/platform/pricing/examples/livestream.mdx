title: Major livestream event
meta_description: "Calculate Ably Chat pricing for livestream events with high-concurrency chat. Example shows 25K concurrent viewers, message batching reducing costs by 95%, and total cost of ~$2,430 for a 1-hour major event."

intro: "This Ably Chat example demonstrates consumption-based pricing for a major live event – thousands of viewers chatting simultaneously during a broadcast. Livestream chat involves high message velocity over a short duration, where batching is essential to manage costs at scale."

### Assumptions
The scale and features used in this calculation.
| Scale | Features |
|-------|----------|
| 25,000 concurrent viewers | ✓ Message batching (100ms window) |
| 1-hour event duration | ✓ Moderation (100% of messages) |
| 100 messages per second | ✓ Room reactions |
| 360,000 total messages | |
| 10,000 room reactions (burst pattern) | |

<Aside data-type='note'>
Batching intervals are configurable from 50ms to 500ms. Lower intervals reduce latency; higher intervals increase batching efficiency.

### Cost summary
The high-level cost breakdown for this scenario. Messages are billed for both inbound (published to Ably) and outbound (delivered to subscribers) – a single message to 100 subscribers generates 101 billable messages.

| Item | Calculation | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Messages (with batching) | ~901M × $2.50/M | $2,252 |
| Room reactions (with batching) | ~70M × $2.50/M | ~$175 |
| Connection minutes | 1.5M mins × $1.00/M mins | $2 |
| Moderation (Ably) | ~360K msgs × 1 rule invocatio | $1 |
| Package fee |  | [See plans](/pricing) |
| **Total** |  | **~$2,430** |


### Message breakdown
How the message cost breaks down by type. 

| Type | Inbound | Outbound | Total | Cost |
|------|---------|----------|-------|------|
| Chat messages | 360K | 900M | 900.36M | $2,251 |
| Moderation* | 360K | — | 360K | $0.90 |
| Room reactions | 10K | 70M | 70.01M | $175 |
| **Total** | **730K** | **970M** | **970.73M** | **$2,427** |

<Aside data-type='note'>
Third-party moderation providers (Hive, Bodyguard, Tisane) are billed separately.

### Batching impact
How batching reduces costs at scale. Actual savings depend on your message patterns – bursty traffic batches more efficiently than steady streams.

| Scenario | Cost | Messages | Savings |
|----------|------|----------|---------|
| Without batching | ~$22,500 | ~9B messages | — |
| With batching | ~$2,350 | ~900M messages | **$20,150** |

### Room reactions calculation

10,000 room reactions to 25,000 viewers would generate 250M outbound messages unbatched.

With batching enabled and assuming 80% of reactions occur in bursts (during key moments), total outbound messages drop to ~70M:

- **Burst reactions (80%):** 8,000 reactions batched into ~800 deliveries × 25K viewers = 20M messages
- **Individual reactions (20%):** 2,000 × 25K viewers = 50M messages

**Total:** 70M messages × $2.50/M = **~$175**
