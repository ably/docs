<Code>
```shell
ably channels subscribe <channels...> [flags]
```
</Code>

Subscribe to messages published on one or more Ably channels.

Use the [`ably channels publish`](/docs/cli/channels/publish) in another terminal instance to publish messages that will be received by the subscriber.

The subscriber will run continuously unless you specify a [`--duration`](#duration), or you stop it using `Ctrl+C`.

## Arguments

### `<channels...>` <a id="channels"/>

One or more channel names to subscribe to, for example:

* `example-channel`
* `example-channel-1 example-channel-2`

## Flags

In addition to the [global flags](/docs/cli#global-flags), the `ably channels subscribe` command supports:

### `--cipher-algorithm` <a id="cipher-algorithm"/>

Encryption algorithm to use for decrypting messages. The default is `aes`.

### `--cipher-key` <a id="cipher-key"/>

Encryption key for decrypting messages, provided as a hex-encoded string.

### `--cipher-key-length` <a id="cipher-key-length"/>

Length of the encryption key in bits. The default is `256`.

### `--cipher-mode` <a id="cipher-mode"/>

Cipher mode to use for decryption. The default is `cbc`.

### `--delta` <a id="delta"/>

Enable [delta compression](/docs/channels/options/deltas) for messages. When delta compression is enabled, message payloads will only contain the difference between the present and previous message sent to the channel. Set to `true` to enable. The default is `false`.

### `--duration | -D` <a id="duration"/>

Automatically stop subscribing after the given number of seconds. Set to `0` to run indefinitely. The default is `0`.

### `--rewind` <a id="rewind"/>

Number of messages to rewind by. This will fetch a certain number of messages that were sent to the channel before you subscribed to it. The default is `0`.

## Examples

### Subscribe to a single channel

Subscribe to receive messages on a channel:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels subscribe example-channel
```
</Code>

You can test this functionality by publishing a message in another terminal instance:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels publish example-channel "Hello from terminal 2!"
```
</Code>

**Output:**
<Code>
```text
Using: App=example-app (Ab1CdE) • Key=example-key (Ab1CdE.FgHiJk)

Subscribing to channel: example-channel
✓ Successfully subscribed. Waiting for messages... (Press Ctrl+C to exit)

[2025-01-20T10:30:45.123Z] example-channel
Event: (none)
Client ID: ably-cli-abc123
Data:
Hello from terminal 2!
```
</Code>

### Subscribe to multiple channels

Subscribe to messages on multiple channels simultaneously:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels subscribe example-channel-1 example-channel-2
```
</Code>

**Output:**
<Code>
```text
Using: App=example-app (Ab1CdE) • Key=example-key (Ab1CdE.FgHiJk)

Subscribing to channels: example-channel-1, example-channel-2
✓ Successfully subscribed. Waiting for messages... (Press Ctrl+C to exit)
```
</Code>

### Subscribe with automatic exit

Subscribe for 30 seconds then automatically exit:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels subscribe --duration 30 example-channel
```
</Code>

### Subscribe with message rewind

Subscribe and receive the last 5 messages from the channel:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels subscribe --rewind 5 example-channel
```
</Code>

### Subscribe to encrypted channel

Subscribe to a channel that uses message encryption:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels subscribe --cipher-key "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" example-encrypted-channel
```
</Code>
