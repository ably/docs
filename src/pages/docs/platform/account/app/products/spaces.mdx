The Spaces section of the [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/spaces) provides tools for monitoring and managing collaborative spaces across your application. From this page, you can access getting started guides, explore examples, and monitor spaces.

## Spaces <a id="spaces"/>

The spaces section lists all active spaces with their member counts. Use the search box to filter spaces by name. Click the inspect button (eye icon) on any space to view detailed monitoring information.

## Space inspection <a id="inspection"/>

- Occupancy analytics tracking connections, members, and presence data over time

### Configuration and rules <a id="configuration-rules"/>

The rules section shows the space's configuration including storage rules (message persistence and history retention), space rules (security requirements like identification and TLS), and feature rules (push notifications, message annotations).

### Integrations <a id="integrations"/>
