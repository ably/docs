<!-- Key Approach: Document both 503 (capacity limit) and 504 (gateway timeout) scenarios that map to error 50004, with emphasis on rate limiting and exponential backoff for recovery -->

# Error 50004: Service Unavailable (Capacity Limit)

## What Happened

Ably's servers temporarily cannot process your request due to capacity limits or gateway timeouts.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 50004 | 503/504 | Server Error (Rate Limiting) | Yes - with exponential backoff |

## Quick Fix

- Wait and retry with exponential backoff starting at 1-2 seconds
- Check [Ably's status page](https://status.ably.com) for any ongoing issues
- Spread your requests over time if sending high volumes

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Service Unavailable while processing request (server at capacity limit - please retry with exponential backoff)"
- "Service Unavailable while establishing connection (server connection rate limit exceeded - please retry with exponential backoff)"
- "Service Unavailable while publishing message (server publish rate limit exceeded - please retry with exponential backoff)"
- "Service Unavailable while creating channel (server channel creation rate limit exceeded - please retry with exponential backoff)"
- Gateway timeout responses (HTTP 504) without specific error text

## Common Causes

1. **Server capacity limits reached** (80% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50004-analysis.md lines 57-69 -->
   - High traffic volume exceeding instance capacity
   - Server entering protective "siege mode" during overload
   - Instance-level rate limiting triggered

2. **Connection rate limiting** (10% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50004-analysis.md lines 21-26 -->
   - Too many new connections being established simultaneously
   - Connection burst exceeding server limits

3. **Message publish rate limiting** (5% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50004-analysis.md lines 28-33 -->
   - Publishing messages too rapidly
   - Batch publish operations exceeding rate limits

4. **Gateway timeouts** (5% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50004-analysis.md lines 48-54 -->
   - Upstream service timeout (HTTP 504)
   - Network or infrastructure delays

## Resolution Steps

1. **Implement exponential backoff retry**
   <!-- Source: All error messages in analysis explicitly recommend exponential backoff, https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50004-analysis.md lines 17-37 -->
   - Start with a 1-2 second delay
   - Double the delay for each retry (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s...)
   - Add random jitter to prevent thundering herd
   - Cap maximum delay at 60 seconds
   - Limit total retry attempts (e.g., 5-10 retries)

2. **Check service status**
   <!-- Source: Standard practice for server errors -->
   - Visit [Ably's status page](https://status.ably.com) for any reported issues
   - Check if the issue is widespread or isolated

3. **Optimize request patterns**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file recommendations from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50004-knowledge.md lines 87-92 -->
   - Spread high-volume operations across time periods
   - Avoid burst traffic patterns
   - Consider implementing client-side rate limiting
   - Use batch operations judiciously during peak times

4. **For persistent issues**
   <!-- Source: Standard escalation practice -->
   - Review your usage patterns for optimization opportunities
   - Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits
   - Contact support with request patterns and timing details

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically implement exponential backoff for this error. The SDK will:
<!-- Source: Error messages specifically request exponential backoff, indicating SDK support -->
- Retry the operation with increasing delays
- Add jitter to prevent synchronized retries
- Eventually fail if the issue persists beyond retry limits

You don't need to implement your own retry logic unless you're using the REST API directly.

## Prevention

- **Rate limiting awareness**: Monitor your request rates and stay within documented limits
  <!-- Source: Knowledge file patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50004-knowledge.md lines 24-30 -->
- **Load distribution**: Spread high-volume operations across time
- **Connection pooling**: Reuse connections instead of creating new ones
- **Batch wisely**: Use batch operations but be mindful of size and frequency
- **Monitor patterns**: Track 50004 errors as early capacity warning indicators

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Specific numeric rate limits for connections, publishes, and channel creation
