title: Room reactions
meta_description: "Enable users to send reactions at the room level, based on what is happening in your application, such as a goal being scored in your livestream."
---

Users can send reactions to the entire chat room to show their sentiment as to what is happening. For example, agreeing with the content in a livestream using a thumbs up, or sending a heart when their team scores in a sports game.

Room reactions are ephemeral and not stored or aggregated by Ably. The intention being that they show the overall sentiment of a room at a point in time.

## Subscribe to room reactions <a id="subscribe"/>

<If lang="javascript,swift,kotlin">
Subscribe to room reactions by registering a listener. Use the <If lang="javascript">[`reactions.subscribe()`](/docs/sdk/chat-js/v0/interfaces/chat-js.RoomReactions.html#subscribe)</If><If lang="swift">[`reactions.subscribe()`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-swift/main/AblyChat/documentation/ablychat/roomreactions/subscribe%28%29-64gdf)</If><If lang="kotlin">[`reactions.subscribe()`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-kotlin/main/dokka/chat-android/com.ably.chat/-room-reactions/subscribe.html)</If> method in a room to receive reactions:
</If>

<If lang="react">
Subscribe to room reactions with the [`useRoomReactions`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/functions/chat_react.useRoomReactions.html) hook. Supply an optional listener to receive the room reactions.
</If>

<Code>
```javascript
const {unsubscribe} = room.reactions.subscribe((reaction) => {
  console.log(`Received a reaction of type ${reaction.type}, and metadata ${reaction.metadata}`);
});
```

```react
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import { useRoomReactions } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  useRoomReactions({
    listener: (reaction) => {
      console.log('Received reaction: ', reaction);
    },
  });
};
```

```swift
let reactionSubscription = room.reactions.subscribe()
for await reaction in reactionSubscription {
  print("Received a reaction of type \(reaction.type), and metadata \(reaction.metadata)")
}
```

```kotlin
val subscription = room.reactions.subscribe { reaction: Reaction ->
    println("received a ${reaction.type} with metadata ${reaction.metadata}")
}
```
</Code>

### Room reaction event structure <a id="structure"/>

The following is the structure of a room reaction event:

<Code>
```json
{
  "type": "like",
  "headers": {},
  "metadata": {
    "fireworks": "blue",
  },
  "clientId": "R3hegPCqgV3DZoMA2sCT-",
  "createdAt": "2024-06-12T11:37:59.988Z",
  "isSelf": true
}
```
</Code>

The following are the properties of a room reaction:

<If lang="javascript,react">

| Property | Description | Type |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- |
| type | The type of reaction event. | String |
| reaction | The reaction data. | Object |
| | `type`: The type of reaction, for example a 'like' or a heart emoji. | String |
| | `headers`: Optional headers for adding additional information to a reaction. | Object |
| | `metadata`: Optional metadata about the reaction, such as an animation or effect. This information is not read by Ably. | Object |
| | `createdAt`: The time the reaction was sent. | Date |
| | `clientId`: The client identifier of the user that sent the reaction. | String |
| | `isSelf`: Will be `true` for the user that sent the reaction. | Boolean |

</If>

<If lang="kotlin,swift">

| Property | Description | Type |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- |
| type | The type of reaction, for example a 'like' or a heart emoji. | String |
| headers | Optional headers for adding additional information to a reaction. | Object |
| metadata | Optional metadata about the reaction, such as an animation or effect. This information is not read by Ably. | Object |
| createdAt | The time the reaction was sent. | Date |
| clientId | The client identifier of the user that sent the reaction. | String |
| isSelf | Will be `true` for the user that sent the reaction. | Boolean |

</If>

### Unsubscribe from room reactions <a id="unsubscribe"/>

<If lang="javascript">
Use the `unsubscribe()` function returned in the `subscribe()` response to remove a room reaction listener:
</If>

<If lang="swift">
You don't need to handle removing listeners, as this is done automatically by the SDK.
</If>

<If lang="kotlin">
Use the `unsubscribe()` method on the returned subscription to remove a room reaction listener:
</If>

<If lang="react">
When you unmount the component that is using the `useRoomReactions` hook, it will automatically handle unsubscribing any associated listeners registered for room reactions.
</If>

<If lang="javascript,kotlin">
<Code>
```javascript
// Initial subscription
const {unsubscribe} = room.reactions.subscribe((reaction) => {
  console.log(`Received a reaction of type ${reaction.type}, and metadata ${reaction.metadata}`);
});

// To remove the listener
unsubscribe();
```

```kotlin
subscription.unsubscribe()
```
</Code>
</If>

## Send a room reaction <a id="send"/>

<If lang="javascript,swift,kotlin">
Use the <If lang="javascript">[`reactions.send()`](/docs/sdk/chat-js/v0/interfaces/chat-js.RoomReactions.html#send)</If><If lang="swift">[`reactions.send()`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-swift/main/AblyChat/documentation/ablychat/roomreactions/send%28params%3A%29)</If><If lang="kotlin">[`reactions.send()`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-kotlin/main/dokka/chat-android/com.ably.chat/-room-reactions/send.html)</If> method to send a room-level reaction. The most common way of using this method is to trigger it whenever a user clicks an emoji button in a room:
</If>

<If lang="react">
Use the [`send()`](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-react.UseRoomReactionsResponse.html#send) method available from the response of the `useRoomReactions` hook to emit an event when a user reacts, for example when they click an emoji button:
</If>

<Code>
```javascript
await room.reactions.send({type: "like"});

await room.reactions.send({type: "heart", metadata: {"effect": "fireworks"}});
```

```react
import { useRoomReactions } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { send } = useRoomReactions();

  const sendLike = () => {
    send({ type: 'like' });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={sendLike}>Send Like</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```swift
try await room.reactions.send(params: .init(type: "like"))

try await room.reactions.send(params: .init(type: "heart",
                              metadata: ["effect": "fireworks"]))
```

```kotlin
room.reactions.send(type = "like")
room.reactions.send(type = "heart", metadata = JsonObject().apply {
  addProperty("effect", "fireworks")
})
```
</Code>
