Presence provides awareness of other clients that are connected and present on a channel. Each member present on a channel has a unique client identifier and an optional payload that can be used to describe the member's status or attributes. Presence allows you to quickly build apps such as chat rooms or multiplayer games as Ably will automatically keep track of who is present in real time across any device.

h3. Broadcast your presence & subcribe to presence events

Ably Channels support the concept of presence. Each channel may have a presence set associated with it, which is a set of clientIds for those clients that have announced their presence by entering the channel.

```[ruby]
EventMachine.run do
  client = Ably::Realtime::Client.new(api_key: '<%= %>', client_id: 'bob')

  client.channel('realtime-chat').attach do |channel|
    channel.presence.on(:enter) do |presence_message|
      puts "#{presence_message.client_id} entered realtime-chat"
    end

    channel.presence.enter
  end
end
```

```[javascript,nodejs]
var client = Ably.Realtime.Client({ key: '', clientId: 'bob' });

client.channel('realtime-chat').attach(function(channel) {
  channel.presence.on('enter', function(presenceMessage) {
    console.log(presenceMessage.memberKey() + ' entered realtime-chat');
  });

  channel.presence.enter();
});
```

A client must be attached to a channel, and must have the relevant permission, in order to enter. Although, the library implicitly calls <span lang="ruby">#attach</span><span lang="javascript,nodejs">attach()</span> if the client is not attached at the time <span lang="javascript,nodejs">enter()</span> is called.

A given <span lang="javascript,nodejs">clientId</span><span lang="ruby">client_id</span> might be present multiple times, via different connections. As far as Ably is concerned these are different members of the presence set. A member of the presence set is, therefore, the combination of a <span lang="javascript,nodejs">clientId</span><span lang="ruby">client_id</span> string and a <span lang="javascript,nodejs">connectionId</span><span lang="ruby">connection_id</span> string unique to a connection.

h3. Managing multiple client ID

An Ably client instance might, if on an application server for example, publish messages on behalf of multiple distinct clientIds. The channel's @presence@ object therefore also supports methods that enable presence messages to be published for a clientId specified at the time of the call, rather than for a clientId specified when the library was instanced.

In order to be able to publish presence changes for arbitrary clientIds, the client library must have been instanced either with a key, or with a token bound to the wildcard clientId.

```[ruby]
channel = client.channel('realtime-chat')

channel.presence.on(:enter) do |presence_message|
  puts "#{presence_message.client_id} entered realtime-chat"
end

channel.presence.enter_client('bob') # bob entered realtime-chat
channel.presence.enter_client('mary') # mary entered realtime-chat
```

```[javascript,nodejs]
var channel = client.channel('realtime-chat');

channel.presence.on('enter', function(presenceMessage) {
  console.log(presenceMessage.client_id + 'entered realtime-chat');
});

channel.presence.enterClient('bob'); // bob entered realtime-chat
channel.presence.enterClient('mary'); // mary entered realtime-chat
```

In this example, you have to connect with a different client ID. Submitting the same client ID wouldn't submit any other @ENTER@ event.

```[ruby]
channel.presence.on(:enter) do |presence_message|
  puts "#{presence_message.client_id} entered realtime-chat"
end

channel.presence.enter_client('bob') # bob entered realtime-chat
channel.presence.enter_client('bob') # (this prints nothing)
```

```[javascript,nodejs]
channel.presence.on('enter', function(presenceMessage) {
  console.log(presenceMessage.clientId + " entered realtime-chat");
});

channel.presence.enterClient('bob'); // bob entered realtime-chat
channel.presence.enterClient('bob'); // (this prints nothing)
```

h3. Payload

In addition to the <span lang="javascript,nodejs">clientId</span><span lang="ruby">client_id</span> for members on a channel, it is also possible to include a data payload. Clients can "update":#update their data at any point whilst present on a channel.

```[ruby]
channel.presence.on(:enter) do |presence_message|
  puts presence_message.client_id # => bob
  puts presence_message.data      # => robert@example.com
end

channel.presence.enter(client_id: 'bob', data: 'robert@example.com')
```

```[javascript,nodejs]
channel.presence.on('enter', function(presenceMessage) {
  console.log(presenceMessage.clientId); // => bob
  console.log(presenceMessage.data);     // => robert@example.com
});
end

channel.presence.enter({ clientId: 'bob', data: 'robert@example.com' })
```

A number of presence actions are therefore defined.

- enter := A clientId, or a clientId/connectionId combination, is entering the presence channel.

- leave := A clientId, or a clientId/connectionId combination, is leaving the presence channel.

- update := An already-present clientId or clientId/connectionId combination has been updated.

- present := An already-present clientId or clientId/connectionId combination is signaling its presence on the channel. (happens only when a listener is bound to the channel)

h3. Presence list

A Channel's @presence@ <span lang="default">property</span><span lang="java">field</span> exposes a @get@ method whereby a client can discover the set of all members present on the channel.

```[ruby]
channel.presence.get do |members|
  puts "There are #{members.size} members on this channel"
end
```

```[javascript,nodejs]
channel.presence.get(function(members) {
  console.log("There are " + members.length + " members on this channel")
});
```

The client keeps track of the presence set from the time that the channel is attached; a up to date presence set is delivered to the client following attach, and the presence set is updated on each message seen subsequently. Thus this @get@ method synchronously returns the already-known presence set, and does not trigger a new request to the Ably service.

h3. Presence History

The @Presence@ API exposes a @history@ method whereby a client can obtain presence updates previously sent on the channel. It provides access to the persisted history, as with the REST API, but also enables access to instantaneous or "live" history for attached channels.

This live history provides the ability to obtain continuous presence history up to the point that a realtime channel was attached and also supports recent history for channels that do not have persistence enabled.

History results are paginated and therefore accompanied with one or more relative links relating to the current query. Where the number of results returned exceeds the query limit - which is either the value of the @limit@ param or the default limit of 100 - the query result contains pages with the limited number of records, and a relative link to the next page.

```[ruby]
channel.presence.history(direction: :backwards) do |messages|
  messages.each do |presence_message|
    puts "#{presence_message.action}: #{presence_message.client_id}"
  end
end
```

```[javascript,nodejs]
var params = {direction: 'backwards', limit: '100'};

channel.presence.history(params, function(err, messages, rel) {
  if(err) {
    console.log('Unable to get presence history; err = ' + err.message);
  } else {
    console.log(messages.length + ' presence messages received in first result');
    if(rel && rel.next) {
      channel.presence.history(rel.next, function(...) { ... });
    }
});
```

```[java]
import io.ably.types.PresenceMessage;
import io.ably.types.Param;
import io.ably.types.PaginatedResult;

Param[] params = new Param[] {
  new Param("direction", "backwards"),
  new Param("limit", 100)
};

PaginatedResult<PresenceMessage> messages = channel.presence.history(params);
System.out.println(messages.asArray().length + " presence messages received in first result");

if(messages.getNext()) {
  PaginatedResult<PresenceMessage> nextPage = channel.presence.history(messages.getNext());
  System.out.println(...);
}
```

See the "history":/realtime/history documentation for further details of the supported query parameters.

```

Further details of the paginated response are in the "history API":/realtime/history documentation.
</div>

h2(#presence-message). PresenceMessage

A @PresenceMessage@ encapsulates an individual presence update sent or received in Ably. A presence message has the following members.

- <span lang="java">String</span>clientId := The id of the client associated with the update. This <span lang="default">property</span><span lang="java">field</span> is populated by the system, where the clientId is known, for messages delivered to subscribers. It is not required to populate the clientId of a message before publishing it.

- <span lang="java">String</span>connectionId := A unique id for the client associated with the update, to disambiguate in the case that a single clientId is simultaneously present multiple times (eg on different connections). This <span lang="default">property</span><span lang="java">field</span> is populated by the system, where the connectionId is known, for messages delivered to subscribers.

- <span lang="java">Object</span>clientData := An optional message payload for a status line or other data associated with the presence update. The data may be one of the supported payload datatypes.

h2(#presence-listener). PresenceListener

<div lang="javascript,nodejs">
A @PresenceListener@ function may be subscribed for all presence messages received on the channel. The message is passed as the first argument to the listener.
</div>
<div lang="java">
A implementation of the @PresenceListener@ interface may be registered to be notified of  arrival of presence messages on the channel. A @PresenceMessage[]@ is passed as the first argument of the listener's @onPresenceMessage@ method whenever a presence message is received on the channel.
</div>

<div lang="java">
h2(#paginated-result). PaginatedResult

A @PaginatedResult@ is an interface that represents the result of a query that supports pagination. An instance of @PaginatedResult@ encapsulates a collection of @PresenceMessage@ objects representing the current page of results, and provides the means - in the form of @Param[]@ to perform queries for subsequent or related pages.

- public PresenceMessage[] asArray() := Returns the current page of results as an Array.
- public List&lt;PresenceMessage&gt; := Returns the current page of results as a List.
- public Param[] getFirst() := Returns the params to pass to a @history()@ call to reproduce the first call in this paginated sequence.
- public Param[] getCurrent() := Returns the params to pass to a @history()@ call to reproduce the current call in this paginated sequence.
- public Param[] getNext() := Returns the params to pass to a @history()@ call to reproduce the next call in this paginated sequence.

</div>
