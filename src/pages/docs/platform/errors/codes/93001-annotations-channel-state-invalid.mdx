# Error 93001: Annotations channel state invalid

## What Happened

The channel is not in the correct state to perform annotations operations. The channel must be attached before you can use annotations features.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 93001 | 400 | Client Error (Annotations) | No - requires channel attachment |

## Quick Fix

- Ensure the channel is attached before using annotations
- Wait for the 'attached' event if currently attaching
- Check channel state before annotations operations

## Error Messages

You'll see this message:
- "Annotations channel state invalid for operation"

## Common Causes

1. **Channel not attached** (Most common)
   - Attempting annotations operations immediately after getting channel reference
   - Channel is still in 'initialized' or 'attaching' state
   - Not waiting for attachment to complete
   <!-- Source: Based on analysis findings in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93001-analysis.md lines 22-24 -->

2. **Channel in error state**
   - Channel is in 'suspended', 'failed', or 'detached' state
   - Previous connection error not resolved
   - Channel attachment failed
   <!-- Source: From knowledge of channel states in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93001-knowledge.md lines 14-20 -->

3. **Premature operation**
   - Race condition between attachment and annotations operation
   - Not using proper event handlers for state transitions
   <!-- Source: Inferred from state requirements and common async patterns -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Ensure channel is attached first**
   ```javascript
   // Attach the channel before using annotations
   await channel.attach();
   
   // Now annotations operations are safe
   channel.annotations.subscribe((annotation) => {
     console.log('Annotation received:', annotation);
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Resolution approach from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93001-knowledge.md lines 25-33 -->

2. **Check channel state before operations**
   ```javascript
   if (channel.state === 'attached') {
     // Safe to use annotations
     channel.annotations.subscribe();
   } else {
     // Wait for attachment
     channel.once('attached', () => {
       channel.annotations.subscribe();
     });
   }
   ```
   <!-- Source: State checking pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93001-knowledge.md lines 35-44 -->

3. **Handle attachment with callbacks**
   ```javascript
   channel.attach((err) => {
     if (err) {
       console.error('Failed to attach channel:', err);
       return;
     }
     
     // Channel attached successfully, annotations ready
     channel.annotations.subscribe();
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Callback pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93001-knowledge.md lines 25-33 -->

4. **Monitor channel state changes**
   ```javascript
   channel.on('attached', () => {
     console.log('Channel attached - annotations available');
   });
   
   channel.on('detached', () => {
     console.log('Channel detached - annotations unavailable');
   });
   
   channel.on('failed', () => {
     console.log('Channel failed - recreate connection');
   });
   ```

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs do not automatically retry annotations operations. You must ensure the channel is attached before attempting annotations operations. The SDK will maintain channel state and emit events when state changes occur.

## Prevention

- Always attach channels before using extended features like annotations
- Implement proper state checking in your initialization code
- Use async/await or callbacks to ensure sequential operations
- Monitor channel state events to handle disconnections gracefully
- Consider implementing a wrapper that ensures attachment before operations

## Code Examples

### Proper Annotations Setup
```javascript
// Initialize Ably client
const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ key: 'your-api-key' });

// Get channel reference
const channel = ably.channels.get('my-channel');

// Ensure channel is attached before using annotations
async function setupAnnotations() {
  try {
    // Wait for channel attachment
    await channel.attach();
    console.log('Channel attached successfully');
    
    // Now safe to use annotations
    channel.annotations.subscribe((annotation) => {
      console.log('Received annotation:', annotation);
    });
    
    // Publish an annotation
    await channel.annotations.publish({
      type: 'comment',
      text: 'This is an annotation'
    });
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to setup annotations:', error);
  }
}

setupAnnotations();
```
