h2. What's covered

The Ably documentation is broken down as follows:

* Getting started & key concepts: "Quick start guide":/root/quick-start-guide, "How Ably works":/root/how-ably-works, and "Usage Limits & Billing":/root/usage-limits-billing/
* "Realtime client library API documentation":/realtime/
* "REST client library API documentation":/rest/
* "REST API documentation":/rest-api/.  Note, we recommend you use one of our REST client libraries instead of accessing the Ably REST API directly as the client libraries abstract away underlying complexity and provide a rich convenient feature set to developers.
* More detail behind some of Ably's key features: "Authentication":/general/authentication, "Channel Rules & Namespaces":/general/channel-rules-namespaces/, "Receiving WebHooks":/general/webhooks, and "Application statistics":/general/statistics/
* Documentation targeted at client library developers including "Protocol documentation":/client-lib-development-guide/protocol/, details on "Encryption":/client-lib-development-guide/encryption/, and "our fallback mechanisms to ensure we can deliver on our 100% uptime guarantee":/client-lib-development-guide/connection-fallback/.  Unless you are developing or extending an existing Ably client library, this documentation is most likely more low level than is needed for you to use the Ably realtime message service.
