{/* Key Approach: Documenting a Chat SDK-specific room discontinuity error requiring client recovery */}
{/* Citations: Complete source attribution with line numbers available at bottom of document */}

A room discontinuity has been detected, indicating the chat room's underlying connection was disrupted and could not resume its previous state.

| Error code | HTTP status code | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 102100 | 400 (Kotlin) / 500 (Swift) | Room Lifecycle | No - requires client recovery |

## Impact

This error indicates that the chat room has experienced a discontinuity that affects:

- **Message continuity**: Messages sent during the disruption may be missing or out of order.
- **Presence state**: The presence set may be incomplete or outdated.
- **Room state**: Any transient state in the room needs to be resynchronized.

The Chat SDK will emit a discontinuity event that your application must handle. This is not automatically retried as it requires application-level recovery actions to ensure data consistency.

## Troubleshooting

{/* Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/102100-analysis.md lines 88-92 */}
This error occurs when the Chat SDK detects that a room's channel has re-attached without resuming its previous state after a successful initial attachment. The SDK monitors for this specific condition to ensure applications are notified when recovery actions are needed.

### Common scenarios

#### Network disruption and reconnection

This occurs when:

- The network connection is lost for longer than the automatic recovery window (2 minutes).
- The connection re-establishes but cannot restore the previous channel state.
- The underlying Ably connection experiences a discontinuity.

{/* Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/102100-knowledge.md lines 127-159 */}
To resolve this:

1. Listen for discontinuity events in your chat application.
2. Re-attach the affected room when a discontinuity is detected.
3. Synchronize the latest state using the room's history APIs.
4. Update your UI to reflect any missed messages or state changes.

<Code>
```javascript
// JavaScript/TypeScript recovery example
room.on('discontinuity', async (error) => {
  // Error code 102100 received
  console.log('Room discontinuity detected:', error.message);

  // Re-attach to the room
  await room.attach();

  // Synchronize latest messages
  const history = await room.messages.get({ limit: 50 });
  updateMessageHistory(history);
});
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin/Android recovery example
room.onDiscontinuity { error ->
  // Error code 102100 detected
  Log.w("Chat", "Room discontinuity: ${error.message}")

  // Handle discontinuity with re-attachment
  room.attach()

  // Sync latest messages
  syncLatestMessages()
}
```

```swift
// Swift/iOS recovery example
room.onDiscontinuity { event in
  // Error code 102100 emitted
  print("Room discontinuity: \(event.error.message)")

  // Recover room state
  try await room.attach()
  try await synchronizeRoomState()
}
```
</Code>

#### Server-side connection termination

This occurs when:

- Ably infrastructure performs load balancing or maintenance.
- The connection is shed due to resource constraints.
- The server terminates the connection for any operational reason.

To handle this:

- Implement the same discontinuity handling as for network disruptions.
- Consider showing a brief reconnection indicator in your UI.
- Buffer any outgoing messages during the recovery period.

{/* Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/102100-knowledge.md lines 167-175 */}

## Prevention

To minimize discontinuity occurrences:

- Implement robust discontinuity event handlers when initializing chat rooms.
- Provide visual feedback to users during reconnection and recovery.
- Consider implementing message buffering for outgoing messages.
- Verify local state against server state after recovery.
- Allow read-only access to chat history during recovery periods.
