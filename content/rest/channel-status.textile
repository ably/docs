h2(#overview). Overview
<!-- 
The @Channel Status API@ provides the capability to access information about channels via the Ably REST endpoint. The information includes the current state of a channel, or its current occupancy. This data can be accessed as follows:

* "Requesting":/api/rest-sdk#request the "channel status":#channel-status of a single channel.
* "Enumerating":#enumeration-rest all currently active channels within an app, optionally providing the "channel status":#channel-status of each enumerated channel.

At present, REST "requests":/api/rest-sdk#request for lifecycle events do not count towards your message limit. If you are making use of "Integrations":/general/integrations however, then each message sent through Integrations *will* count towards your message limits.

Note that it is also possible to use the "realtime endpoint":/realtime to subscribe to:

* "Metachannels":/realtime/metachannels - to obtain channel and connection lifecycle metadata.
* "Inband channel occupancy events":/realtime/inband-occupancy - to obtain occupancy metrics such as the counts of publishers, subscribers or presence members as they are added or removed.

Note that since the metadata of various channels is prone to change very frequently, unless you have a special use case within your app, Ably recommends you subscribe to the realtime events using "metchannels":/realtime/metachannels or "inband channel occupancy":/realtime/inband-occupancy rather than polling for status updates via REST, as this is inefficient and data is likely to become stale as soon as you have received it. -->

h2(#channel-status). Requesting Channel Status
<!-- 
Through the REST library, it is possible to not only check a channel's "status":#metadata-rest and "occupancy data":#occupancy, but it is also possible to "enumerate":#enumeration-rest all channels that are currently active within an app. -->
