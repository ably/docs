This guide will get you started with Ably Pub/Sub in Go.

You'll establish a realtime connection to Ably and learn to publish and subscribe to messages. You'll also implement presence to track other online clients, and learn how to retrieve message history.

## Prerequisites <a id="prerequisites"/>

1. [Sign up](https://ably.com/signup) for an Ably account.
2. Create a [new app](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/new), and create your first API key in the **API Keys** tab of the dashboard.
3. Your API key will need the `publish`, `subscribe`, `presence` and `history` capabilities.
4. Install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) version 1.18 or greater.
5. Create a new project in your IDE and install the Ably Pub/Sub Go SDK:

<Code>
```shell
mkdir ably-go-quickstart
cd ably-go-quickstart
go mod init ably-go-quickstart

go get -u github.com/ably/ably-go/ably
```
</Code>

### (Optional) Install Ably CLI <a id="install-cli"/>

The [Ably CLI](https://github.com/ably/cli) provides a command-line interface for managing your Ably applications directly from your terminal.

1. Install the Ably CLI:

<Code>
```shell
npm install -g @ably/cli
```
</Code>

2. Run the following to log in to your Ably account and set the default app and API key:

<Code>
```shell
ably login
```
</Code>

<If loggedIn={false}>
  <Aside data-type='note'>
  The code examples in this guide include a demo API key. If you wish to interact with the Ably CLI and view outputs within your Ably account, ensure that you replace them with your own API key.
  </Aside>
</If>

## Step 1: Connect to Ably <a id="step-1"/>

Clients establish a connection with Ably when they instantiate an SDK instance. This enables them to send and receive messages in realtime across channels.

Create a `main.go` file in your project and add the following function to instantiate the SDK and establish a connection to Ably. At the minimum you need to provide an authentication mechanism. Use an API key for simplicity, but you should use [token authentication](/docs/auth/token) in production environments. A [`clientId`](/docs/auth/identified-clients) ensures the client is identified, which is required to use certain features, such as presence:

<Code>
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/ably/ably-go/ably"
)

func main() {
	client, err := ably.NewRealtime(
		ably.WithKey("{{API_KEY}}"),
		ably.WithClientID("my-first-client"),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

	// Wait for the connection to be connected
	connStateChan := make(chan ably.ConnectionStateChange, 1)
	client.Connection.On(ably.ConnectionEventConnected, func(change ably.ConnectionStateChange) {
		connStateChan <- change
	})
	select {
	case <-connStateChan:
		fmt.Println("Made my first connection!")
	case <-context.Background().Done():
		log.Fatal("Context cancelled before connection established")
	}

	// Keep the program running
	select {}
}
```
</Code>

You can monitor the lifecycle of clients' connections by registering a listener that will emit an event every time the connection state changes. For now, run the function with `go run main.go` to log a message to the console to know that the connection attempt was successful. You'll see the message printed to your console, and you can also inspect the connection event in the dev console of your app.

## Step 2: Subscribe to a channel and publish a message <a id="step-2"/>

Messages contain the data that a client is communicating, such as a short 'hello' from a colleague, or a financial update being broadcast to subscribers from a server. Ably uses channels to separate messages into different topics, so that clients only ever receive messages on the channels they are subscribed to.

In your `main()` function, before the line `// Keep the program running`, add the following to create a channel instance and register a listener to subscribe to the channel. Then run it with `go run main.go`:

<Code>
```go
channel := client.Channels.Get("my-first-channel")

// Subscribe to messages
unsubscribe, err := channel.SubscribeAll(context.Background(), func(msg *ably.Message) {
  fmt.Printf("Received message: %s\n", msg.Data)
})

if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
defer unsubscribe()
```
</Code>

Use the Ably CLI to publish a message to your first channel. The message will be received by the client you've subscribed to the channel, and be logged to the console.

<Code>
```shell
ably channels publish my-first-channel 'Hello!'
```
</Code>

In a new terminal tab, subscribe to the same channel using the CLI:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels subscribe my-first-channel
```
</Code>

Publish another message using the CLI and you will see that it's received instantly by the client you have running locally, as well as the subscribed terminal instance.

To publish a message in your code, you can add the following line to your `main` function after subscribing to the channel:

<Code>
```go
err = channel.Publish(context.Background(), "example", "A message sent from my first client!")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
```
</Code>

## Step 3: Join the presence set <a id="step-3"/>

Presence enables clients to be aware of one another if they are present on the same channel. You can then show clients who else is online, provide a custom status update for each, and notify the channel when someone goes offline.

In your `main()` function, before the line `// Keep the program running`, add the following to subscribe to, and join, the presence set of the channel. Then run it with `go run main.go`:

<Code>
```go
// Subscribe to presence events
presenceUnsubscribe, err := channel.Presence.Subscribe(context.Background(), ably.PresenceActionEnter, func(msg *ably.PresenceMessage) {
  fmt.Printf("Event type: %s from %s with the data %v\n", msg.Action, msg.ClientID, msg.Data)
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
defer presenceUnsubscribe()

// Enter the presence set
err = channel.Presence.Enter(context.Background(), "I'm here!")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
```
</Code>

You can have another client join the presence set using the Ably CLI:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels presence enter my-first-channel --data '{"status":"learning about Ably!"}'
```
</Code>

## Step 4: Retrieve message history <a id="step-4"/>

You can retrieve previously sent messages using the history feature. Ably stores all messages for 2 minutes by default in the event a client experiences network connectivity issues. You can [extend the storage period](/docs/storage-history/storage) of messages if required.

If more than 2 minutes has passed since you published a regular message (excluding the presence events), then you can publish some more before trying out history. You can use the Pub/Sub SDK, Ably CLI or the dev console to do this.

For example, using the Ably CLI to publish 5 messages:

<Code>
```shell
ably channels publish --count 5 my-first-channel "Message number {{.Count}}"
```
</Code>

Update your `main()` function to retrieve any messages that were recently published to the channel. Then run it with `go run main.go`:

<Code>
```go
// Add this after channel subscription
pages, err := channel.History().Pages(context.Background())
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

var messages []string
for pages.Next(context.Background()) {
	for _, msg := range pages.Items() {
		messages = append(messages, fmt.Sprintf("%v", msg.Data))
	}
}
if err := pages.Err(); err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

// Print messages in reverse order (newest first)
for i := len(messages) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
	fmt.Println(messages[i])
}
```
</Code>

The output will look similar to the following:

<Code>
```json
[
  'Message number 5',
  'Message number 4',
  'Message number 3',
  'Message number 2',
  'Message number 1'
]
```
</Code>
