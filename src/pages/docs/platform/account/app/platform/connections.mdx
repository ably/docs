The Connections section shows active client connections and their channel subscriptions. Monitor your connections through the [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/connections).

## Connection browser <a id="connection-browser"/>

The connections interface lists currently connected clients. You can filter by connection ID, client ID, country, and SDK version.

Each connection entry displays the connection ID, client ID (if set), geographic location, and SDK version. Click the inspect button (eye icon) to view detailed connection information.

## Connection inspection <a id="connection-inspection"/>

The connection inspection page shows detailed information for a specific connection:

- Connection details (client ID, transport type, creation timestamp, status, IP address, SDK version, platform)
- Authentication configuration (auth type, security protocol, API key identifier)
- Capabilities (which Ably features the client can use)
- Activity metrics (inbound and outbound message rates over time)
- Live logs (realtime events specific to this connection)

## Attached channels <a id="attached-channels"/>

The attached channels tab lists channels that the connection is subscribed to, including connection modes (presence, publish, subscribe) and activity metrics. Click inspect on any channel to navigate to the [channel inspection](/docs/platform/account/app/products/pubsub#inspection) interface.
