This error occurs when your application fails to establish a connection to Ably within the configured timeout period (default: 10 seconds).

| Error code | HTTP status | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- | --------- |
| 80014 | 408/504 | Connection | Yes |

## Error messages

| Message | Context |
| ------- | ------- |
| `Unable to establish connection` | Initial connection attempt timeout |
| `Connecting timeout` | Connection state timeout |
| `Connection to Ably timed out after {N}s` | Explicit timeout with duration |
| `request timed out` | REST API request timeout |

## Impact

This error prevents your application from establishing a realtime connection to Ably. All realtime features remain unavailable until a connection is successfully established.

The SDK automatically retries the connection with exponential backoff. No manual intervention is required for retry logic.

## Troubleshooting

The following are common causes and resolutions for connection timeout errors:

### Network connectivity issues

| Error message | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `Connection to Ably timed out after 10s` | Connection attempt exceeded timeout |

This occurs when:
- Your internet connection is slow or unstable
- Network congestion is affecting connection speed
- You're connecting from a location far from Ably's data centers

To resolve this:
1. Verify your internet connection is working properly
2. Test connection speed and stability using network diagnostic tools
3. Try connecting from a different network to isolate the issue
4. Consider increasing the timeout value for slow networks:

```javascript
const client = new Ably.Realtime({
  key: 'your-api-key',
  realtimeRequestTimeout: 15000, // 15 seconds instead of default 10
  httpRequestTimeout: 20000      // 20 seconds for REST requests
});
```

### Firewall or proxy restrictions

| Error message | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `Unable to establish connection` | Connection blocked or delayed |

This occurs when:
- Corporate firewalls are blocking or delaying WebSocket connections
- Proxy servers are adding significant connection overhead
- Security scanning is causing connection delays

To resolve this:
{/* Source: FAQ content from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/80014-knowledge.md lines 130-137 */}
1. Ensure your firewall allows access to Ably endpoints
2. Verify WebSocket connections are permitted on ports 80 and 443
3. Test connection without VPN or proxy to isolate the issue
4. For corporate networks, work with your IT team to allow Ably traffic
5. Review the [Ably connection requirements documentation](https://ably.com/docs/best-practice-guide#connectivity)

### Mobile network instability

| Error message | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `Connecting timeout` | Mobile network causing delays |

This occurs when:
- Switching between cell towers or WiFi/cellular
- Poor signal strength affecting connection
- Network type transitions (3G/4G/5G)

To resolve this:
1. Implement network quality detection in your application
2. Use appropriate timeout values for mobile environments
3. Provide clear user feedback during connection attempts
4. Consider implementing offline mode functionality

### REST API request timeouts

| Error message | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `request timed out` | REST API call exceeded timeout |

This occurs when:
- REST API requests take too long to complete
- Token requests timeout during authentication
- Publishing operations timeout under load

To resolve this:
1. Check if the issue is consistent or intermittent
2. Monitor for patterns in timeout occurrences
3. Consider implementing request batching to reduce load
4. Review the [Ably REST API documentation](https://ably.com/docs/api/rest-api)

## Prevention

To minimize connection timeout errors:

1. **Configure appropriate timeouts** based on your network environment
2. **Monitor connection patterns** to identify problematic network conditions
3. **Implement progressive timeout increases** for retry attempts
4. **Design for resilience** with offline mode and connection state handling
5. **Use connection quality indicators** to inform users of network issues
