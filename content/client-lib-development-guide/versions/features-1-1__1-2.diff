 * @(G1)@ Every test should be executed using all supported protocols (i.e. JSON and "MessagePack":http://msgpack.org/ if supported).  This includes both sending & receiving data
 * @(G2)@ All tests by default are run against a special Ably sandbox environment.  This environment allows apps to be provisioned without any authentication that can then be used for client library testing. Bear in mind that all apps created in the sandbox environment are automatically deleted after 60 minutes and have low limits to prevent abuse. Apps are configured by sending a @POST@ request to @https://sandbox-rest.ably.io/apps@ with a JSON body that specifies the keys and their associated capabilities, channel namespace rules and any presence fixture data that is required; see "ably-common test-app-setup.json":https://github.com/ably/ably-common/blob/main/test-resources/test-app-setup.json. Presence fixture data is necessary for the REST library presence tests as there is no way to register presence on a channel in the REST library
 * @(G3)@ Testing statistics can be tricky due to timing issues and slow test suites as a result of sending requests to generate statistics.  As such, we provide a special stats endpoint in our sandbox environment that allows stats to be injected into our metrics system so that stats tests can make predictable assertions.  To create stats you must send an authenticated @POST@ request to the stats JSON to @https://sandbox-rest.ably.io/stats@ with the stats data you wish to create.

If not, the event is put back in its place in the queue. E. g. we're @WaitingForDeregistration@, and an event @CalledActivate@ happens. This event will be put in the queue, since there's no transition defined for it. Then, an event @Deregistered@ arrives, causing a transition to @NotActivated@. Now we peek the next item on the queue: @CalledActivate@. Because @NotActivated@ transitions on @CalledActivate@, the event is consumed and the machine transitions.
 * @(RSH5)@ Event handling is atomic and sequential: while an event is being handled, the next one should be handled only after the current one has caused a state transition or has been put into the pending events queue.

+* @(RSH8)@ In platforms that support receiving push notifications, the @device@ method on the @Rest@ or @Realtime@ interfaces returns an instance of @LocalDevice@ that represents the current state of the device in respect of it being a target for push notifications.
+** @(RSH8a)@ The @LocalDevice@ is initialised when first required, either as a result of a call to @Rest#device@ or @Realtime#device@, or as a result of an operation involving the Activation State Machine. The @LocalDevice@ @id@, @clientId@, @deviceSecret@ and @deviceIdentityToken@ attributes are populated, together with any @recipient@-related attributes, to the extent that they exist, from the persisted state.
+** @(RSH8b)@ The @LocalDevice@ @id@ and @deviceSecret@ attributes are generated, and persisted as part of the @LocalDevice@ state, when required by step "@(RSH3a2b)@":#RSH3a2b in the Activation State Machine. At that time, the @clientId@ attribute is also initialised, if the client is identified according to "@(RSA7)@":#RSA7.
+** @(RSH8c)@ Following successful registration of a @LocalDevice@, following the procedure in "@(RSH3c2a)@":#RSH3c2a, the now known @deviceIdentityToken@ is set and persisted.

+** @(RSH8e)@ If the @LocalDevice@ @clientId@ becomes set as a result of "@(RSH8d)@":#RSH8d, and the @LocalDevice@ is already registered (ie the @deviceIdentityToken@ is set), and the ActivationStateMachine is in any state other than @NotActivated@, then a @GotPushDeviceDetails@ event is sent to "the state machine":#RSH3 once the effects of "@(RSH8d)@":#RSH8d are visible, ie. once @LocalDevice@ @clientId@ is set.
+** @(RSH8f)@ If the @LocalDevice@ is created by an unidentified client (see "@(RSA7)@":#RSA7 ) and therefore has no @clientId@ set, but on receipt of a registration response (see "@(RSH3c2)@":#RSH3c2 ) the registered device has a non-empty @clientId@, then the @LocalDevice@ @clientId@ is set with that @clientId@.
+** @(RSH8g)@ Whenever any change arises of the push transport details for local device (eg an FCM registration token update triggered by the platform), a @GotPushDeviceDetails@ event is sent to "the state machine":#RSH3.
+** @(RSH8h)@ If an attempt to obtain the push transport details for local device (eg an FCM registration token) fails, a @GettingPushDeviceDetailsFailed@ event containing the indicated error is sent to "the state machine":#RSH3.
+** @(RSH8i)@ Each time the library is instanced, if the LocalDevice has push device details (eg an APNS deviceToken), and if the platform supports it, it must verify the validity of those details (eg by requesting a token from the platform and comparing that with the already-known token). If as a result there are updated details, then an update to the Ably server is triggered by sending a @GotPushDeviceDetails@ event to "the state machine":#RSH3.
