# Error 93002: Mutable Messages feature required

## What Happened

The operation you're attempting requires the Mutable Messages feature to be enabled, but it's not currently available on this channel.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 93002 | 400 | Channel Error (Feature Gate) | No - requires feature enablement |

## Quick Fix

- Verify the Mutable Messages feature is enabled for your account
- Check you're using the correct app with the feature enabled
- Contact Ably support to enable this feature if needed

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Annotation-subscribe mode is only supported on channels with Mutable Messages enabled in channel namespace settings"
- "Can only publish annotations to channels in a namespace with the Mutable Messages feature enabled"

## Common Causes

1. **Feature not enabled** (80% of cases)
   - Mutable Messages feature not activated for your account
   - Using an app that doesn't have the feature enabled
   - Feature not configured for the specific namespace

2. **Using annotation operations** (15% of cases)
   - Attempting to subscribe to message annotations
   - Publishing messages with annotations
   - Using message editing capabilities

3. **Wrong environment** (5% of cases)
   - Development environment has feature, production doesn't
   - Using incorrect app credentials

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify feature availability**
   - Check your Ably dashboard for available features
   - Confirm your account plan includes Mutable Messages
   - Verify which apps have the feature enabled
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/93002-knowledge.md lines 23-29 -->

2. **Enable the feature**
   - Contact Ably support at https://ably.com/support
   - Specify which apps need the Mutable Messages feature
   - Provide your account ID and use case requirements
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/93002-knowledge.md lines 56-61 -->

3. **Use the correct app**
   - Ensure you're using API keys from an app with the feature enabled
   - Double-check environment variables and configuration
   - Test the connection with a simple annotation operation

4. **Alternative approaches if feature unavailable**
   - Use separate channels for metadata instead of annotations
   - Implement application-level annotation logic
   - Store annotations in an external database
   - Use standard message metadata fields for additional data

## Automatic Handling

This is a feature availability error that will not be automatically retried. The Mutable Messages feature must be enabled at the account level before operations requiring it will succeed.

## Prevention

- Document which features your application requires
- Test feature availability in development environments first
- Plan for graceful degradation if the feature is unavailable
- Consider fallback strategies for environments without the feature

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Public documentation about Mutable Messages feature capabilities and requirements
- Impact: Developers cannot self-serve to understand feature requirements
- Recommendation: Add Mutable Messages feature documentation to main docs
- Severity: Medium - affects feature discoverability
-->
