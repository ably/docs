A <span lang="java">@io.ably.lib.realtime.ConnectionStateListener@</span> is an interface allowing a client to be notified of connection state change. See "@Connection#on@":/realtime/connection#on to register a listener for one or more events.

```[java]
  public interface ConnectionStateListener {
    // Called when the connection state changes
    public void onConnectionStateChanged(ConnectionStateListener.ConnectionStateChange state);
  }
```
