Errors can occur in various scenarios when using Ably, such as invalid inputs in requests, authentication issues, or connection problems caused by network disruptions. Proper debugging is essential for building a reliable application and troubleshooting.

You can debug issues in your Ably-supported app using the following:

* Set up a custom log handler to capture and manage errors in a way that suits your requirements.
* Meta channels allow you to monitor errors that might not otherwise be visible to clients, providing additional insights into issues.
* The [Dev console](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/console) in your Ably dashboard is a quick and easy way to inspect errors and events, especially during development or debugging.

## Error info <a id="format"/>

All errors returned by Ably are standardized and use the [`ErrorInfo`](/docs/api/rest-sdk/types#error-info) object:

<Code>
```json
{
  "code": 40005,
  "statusCode": 400,
  "cause": "Authentication",
  "nonfatal": false,
  "href": "https://help.ably.io/error/40005"
}
```
</Code>

The following explains each property of an `ErrorInfo` object:

* `code` := Ably-specific numeric code indicating the error type.
* `statusCode` := An HTTP status code providing broader context, such as 400 for a bad request.
* `cause` := A brief description of the issue.
* `nonfatal` := A boolean indicating whether the error is critical.
* `href` := A direct link to Ably's documentation or for quick troubleshooting references.

## Logging <a id="logging"/>

Ably SDKs allow you to customize the function that handles logging. This function is usually set in the options when configuring a client, such as the `ClientOptions` object for Pub/Sub.

Two separate properties can be set:

* `logHandler` := Provides a custom function for each line of log output.
* `logLevel` := The verbosity of the logging output, from silent to trace. In some SDKs this is numeric, and in others string.

The following table explains the `logLevel` setting for the Ably client, which controls how much logging output is shown. Higher levels include more detailed information:

| Level | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `0` | No logs |
| `1` | Errors only |
| `2` | Errors plus connection and channel state changes |
| `3` | Abbreviated debug output |
| `4` | Full debug output |

The following example configures the Ably client to log only error messages using `logLevel:1` and processes them with the function `logWriteFun()`:

<Code>
```javascript
const ablyClient = new Ably.Realtime({
  key: {{API_KEY}},
  logHandler: logWriteFunc,
  logLevel: 1 // Errors only
});
```
</Code>

The following example is a log output for an Ably client configured to log messages using `logLevel:1`:

<Code>
```text
LOG [Level 1]: Ably: ConnectionManager.failQueuedMessages(): failing 1 queued messages, err = [_ErrorInfo: Application Ptz0jg disabled.
(See https://help.ably.io/error/40300 for help.); statusCode=403; code=40300]
```
</Code>

## Metachannels <a id="meta"/>

Ably provides a set of [metachannels](/docs/metadata-stats/metadata/subscribe#metachannels) that expose internal events from the Ably system. These metachannels are be useful for debugging and monitoring, especially when investigating issues not surfaced directly to clients.

<Aside data-type='note'>
Errors returned directly to clients are not published to metachannels. For example, if a client publishes a message but exceeds a channel rate limit, the `publish()` method uses an error callback to notify the client.
</Aside>

There are two metachannels related to [logging:](/docs/metadata-stats/metadata/subscribe#log)

* `[meta]log` := Publishes errors that aren't visible to clients, except those related to push notifications.
* `[meta]log:push` := Similar to `[meta]log`, but only publishes errors related to the delivery of push notifications.

The following example subscribes to the `[meta]log` channel:

<Code>
```javascript
const channel = realtime.channels.get('[meta]log');
channel.subscribe((msg) => {
  console.log(msg);
});
```
</Code>

The following is an example event published to the `[meta]log` channel as an [`ErrorInfo`](#format) object:

<Code>
```json
{
  "code": 40005,
  "statusCode": 400,
  "cause": "Authentication",
  "nonfatal": false,
  "href": "https://help.ably.io/error/40005"
}
```
</Code>

## Dev console <a id="console"/>

The [Dev console](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/console) in your Ably dashboard is a quick and easy way to inspect errors. It provides a live stream of all events in your application, which is especially useful during early-stage development or low-traffic periods when events are easier to track:

* Monitor all live events in your application for detailed insights.
* Test publishing and subscribing to channels to identify and resolve issues with these functions.

<Aside data-type='note'>
The Dev console displays a realtime feed of events. It does not store historical data, so you won't be able to query past events after an error has occurred.
</Aside>

## Support tickets <a id="support"/>

If the provided information does not resolve your issue, contact Ably [support](https://ably.com/support). When contacting, include details such as your app ID, the error code, and any relevant logs to help troubleshoot.

The following information is essential for effective troubleshooting, include as much of the following information as possible:

* Provide timestamps in UTC format.
* Include complete SDK logs from the time of the failure. Ensure these logs show activity before and after the timeout, as SDKs retry failed requests by default.
* Specify which endpoints were accessed. Mention if you use custom client options, the environment setting, and the failing SDK operation.
* State the SDK/s you use, including the platform and versions.
* Include any stack traces related to the error.
* Indicate whether the issue occurs consistently or was a one-time event.
* Provide details to confirm whether the issue was related to your network or Ably's availability. For example, note whether other internet operations were succeeding simultaneously.
* Include the `appID` associated with the request.
