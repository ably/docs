---

The `RoomReactions` interface is used to send and subscribe to ephemeral, room-level reactions.

Access it via `room.reactions`.

---

## Send a room reaction <a id="send"/>

`room.reactions.send()`

Send a reaction to the room including some metadata.

`send(params: SendReactionParams): Promise<void>`

### Parameters

Use the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Type |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `params` | An object containing the type, headers and metadata of the room reaction. | [`SendReactionParams`](#sendreactionparams) |

#### SendReactionParams

The following `SendReactionParams` parameters can be set:

| Parameters | Description | Type |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `name` | The name of the reaction. | String |
| `metadata` | *Optional* Metadata associated with the reaction. | [`Metadata`](#roomreactionmetadata) |
| `headers` | *Optional* Headers associated with the reaction. | [`Headers`](#roomreactionheaders) |

#### RoomReactionHeaders

`RoomReactionHeaders` enable attaching extra info to a reaction. Do not use headers for authoritative information. There is no server-side validation. When reading the headers, treat them like user input.

`RoomReactionHeaders: Record<string, number | string | boolean | null | undefined>`

#### RoomReactionMetadata

`RoomReactionMetadata` enables attaching extra info to a reaction. Do not use metadata for authoritative information. There is no server-side validation. When reading the metadata, treat it like user input.

`RoomReactionMetadata: Record<string, unknown>`

### Returns

Returns a promise. On success, the promise is fulfilled when the reaction was sent. On failure, the promise is rejected with an [`ErrorInfo`](/docs/chat/api/javascript/error-info).

Note that it is possible to receive your own reaction via the reactions listener before this promise resolves.

Throws if:

* The `Connection` is not in the `Connected` state.

<Code>
```javascript
await room.reactions.send({
  name: 'üëç',
  metadata: { userId: 'user123' }
});
```
</Code>
