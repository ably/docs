# Error 40103: Basic authentication requires TLS

## What Happened

Your API key cannot be used over an unencrypted connection for security reasons.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40103 | 401 | Client Error (Authentication) | No - requires enabling TLS or switching authentication method |

## Quick Fix

- Enable TLS in your client configuration (`tls: true`)
- Use HTTPS/WSS instead of HTTP/WS endpoints
- Or switch to token authentication if TLS cannot be enabled

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Invalid use of Basic auth over non-TLS transport"
- "Cannot use Basic Auth over non-TLS connections"
- "Trying to use basic key auth over insecure connection"
- "No authentication parameters supplied" (PHP only)

## Common Causes

1. **TLS disabled in configuration** (80% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40103-analysis.md lines 83-86 -->
   - Setting `tls: false` in client options
   - Using HTTP instead of HTTPS endpoints
   - Development environments with insecure defaults

2. **Network restrictions** (15% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40103-knowledge.md lines 32-38 -->
   - Corporate firewall blocking HTTPS/WSS
   - Proxy configurations forcing HTTP
   - Local development without HTTPS setup

3. **Missing authentication** (5% of cases - PHP only)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40103-analysis.md lines 29-32 -->
   - No API key, token, authUrl, or authCallback provided
   - Empty or null authentication parameters

## Resolution Steps

1. **Enable TLS in your configuration**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40103-knowledge.md lines 50-57 -->
   - For JavaScript: Set `tls: true` in client options
   - For Python: Ensure using HTTPS scheme in connection
   - For Ruby: Enable TLS in client configuration
   - For Go: Remove `NoTLS` option or set to false
   - For PHP: Set `tls` option to true

2. **Verify your endpoints**
   <!-- Source: Editorial notes from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/src/prompts/errors/editorial-notes.md lines 75-78 -->
   - Use `https://rest.ably.io` not `http://rest.ably.io`
   - Use `wss://realtime.ably.io` not `ws://realtime.ably.io`
   - Default endpoints already use TLS

3. **Alternative: Use token authentication**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40103-knowledge.md lines 59-65 -->
   - Token authentication can work over non-TLS connections
   - Generate tokens on your secure server
   - Configure client with `authUrl` or `authCallback`
   - See [Token Authentication documentation](https://ably.com/docs/auth/token)

4. **For development environments**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40103-knowledge.md lines 77-85 -->
   - Use the sandbox environment which supports TLS
   - Set up local HTTPS with self-signed certificates
   - Or switch to token authentication for local testing

## Automatic Handling

This is a security policy error that will not be automatically retried. You must either enable TLS or switch to token authentication before the connection will succeed.

## Prevention

- Always use TLS in production environments
- Default to `tls: true` in all configurations
- Use token authentication for client-side applications
- Never transmit API keys over unencrypted connections
- Configure development environments with HTTPS when possible
