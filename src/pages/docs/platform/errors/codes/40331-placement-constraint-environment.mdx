# Error 40331: Placement constraint environment error

## What Happened

Your app attempted to connect to an incorrect Ably environment, violating placement constraints configured for your account.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40331 | 403 | Client Error (Account Placement) | No - requires configuration fix |

## Quick Fix

- Use your dedicated cluster endpoint (e.g., `acme-realtime.ably.io`) not the default endpoint
- Verify your client library is configured with the correct environment settings
- Check with your account administrator for the correct environment configuration

## Error Messages

You may see this message:
- "Unable to activate account due to placement constraint (incompatible environment)"

## Common Causes

1. **Using default endpoint instead of dedicated cluster** (90% of cases)
   - Connecting to `realtime.ably.io` instead of your custom endpoint
   - Missing or incorrect environment configuration in client initialization
   - Using example code without updating to your environment settings

2. **Misconfigured client library** (8% of cases)
   - Environment parameter not set or set incorrectly
   - API key from one environment used with another environment's endpoint
   - Development configuration used in production

3. **DNS or routing issues** (2% of cases)
   - DNS not resolving to correct cluster
   - Network configuration preventing access to dedicated endpoint

## Resolution Steps

1. **Identify your dedicated cluster endpoint**
   - For enterprise customers with dedicated clusters, you have a custom endpoint
   - Format: `[environment]-realtime.ably.io` (e.g., `acme-realtime.ably.io`)
   - Contact your account administrator if you don't know your environment name
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40331-knowledge.md lines 51-54 -->

2. **Configure your client library with the correct environment**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Wrong: Using default endpoint
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ key: 'your-api-key' });
   
   // ✅ Correct: Specify your dedicated environment
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ 
     key: 'your-api-key',
     environment: 'acme'  // Your environment name
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Based on official documentation referenced in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40331-knowledge.md lines 48-56 -->

3. **Verify your configuration across all services**
   - Check all client applications are using the correct environment
   - Update any hardcoded endpoints in your codebase
   - Ensure CI/CD pipelines use correct environment variables

4. **Test the connection**
   ```javascript
   ably.connection.on('connected', () => {
     console.log('Successfully connected to dedicated cluster');
   });
   
   ably.connection.on('failed', (stateChange) => {
     console.error('Connection failed:', stateChange.reason);
   });
   ```

## Automatic Handling

This is a configuration error that will not be automatically retried. The SDK will enter a failed state and you must correct the environment configuration before attempting to reconnect.

## Prevention

- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of your environment endpoints
- **Environment variables**: Use configuration files or environment variables rather than hardcoding endpoints
- **Code reviews**: Ensure all client initialization code specifies the correct environment
- **Testing**: Verify connections in staging environments before production deployment

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Clear documentation on how enterprise customers should discover their environment name
- Impact: Customers may not know their dedicated cluster endpoint format
- Recommendation: Add a section to enterprise documentation listing environment discovery methods
- Severity: Medium - affects enterprise onboarding experience
-->
