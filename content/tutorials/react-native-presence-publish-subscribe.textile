h2. Introduction

Messaging apps are on the increase recently. The past few years have brought apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Slack etc.
People seem to prefer chat-based applications because they allow for Realtime Interaction. They also add a personal touch to the experience. 
In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a Realtime chat application using React Native and Ably.

React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. To learn more about React Native, please visit "here":https://facebook.github.io/react-native/.

"Ably is a Data Stream Network":https://www.ably.io providing developers everything they need to create, deliver and manage complex projects. Ably solves the hardest parts so they don’t have to. Our 100% data delivery guarantee offers unique peace of mind to stream data between apps, websites, and servers anywhere on earth in milliseconds.

  default: Step 2 - Setting Up React Native
  

To get started first, you need to install the @React Native CLI@ if you don’t already have it installed. To install the @CLI@, run:

```[sh]
 npm install -g react-native-cli
```

After installing the @CLI@, it’s time to create your project. Open a terminal, create a new project called @Ably-presence-publish-subscribe-react-native@:

```[sh]
react-native init Ably_presence_publish_subscribe_react_native
```

Before we continue, let me explain why the project was named that way.

# Ably: We will use the @Ably@ Realtime library for Realtime Interactions
# presence: We will cover the concept of Ably "presence":https://www.ably.io/documentation/realtime/presence/ channels
# publish: We will cover the concept of "publishing":https://www.ably.io/tutorials/publish-subscribe#lang-javascript messages in Ably
# subscribe: We will cover the concept of "subscribing":https://www.ably.io/tutorials/publish-subscribe#lang-javascript to channels and events in Ably
# react-native: We will build the chat application using @React-Native@ 

Note: You can give your project any other name you wish to.

Wait until React Native does all its installations, then you can change directory into the new project and run the application:

```[sh]
#change directory to Ably_presence_publish_subscribe_react_native
cd Ably_presence_publish_subscribe_react_native
#run the application for android
react-native run-android
#run the application for ios
react-native run-ios
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/2b52467070a6dd6ae999ce59e788dff9eac8a84b

If all goes well, you should see a screen that says “Welcome to React Native” come up on your emulator or device.

Next, you will install the required libraries for this app. 

```[sh]
npm install ably ably-react-native express body-parser --save
```
In the above bash command, you installed 4 packages. Here is the explanation of what the four packages are used for:

# Express: This is a Node.js web framework which we’ll use to create our API.
# Body-parser: This library is used by Express to parse body requests.
# Ably: This library is the official @Ably@ library for Node js
# Ably-react-native: This library is the official @Ably@ library for React Native

  default: Step 3 - Creating Our API

First, Create a new file called @server.js@, which serves as your API in our root folder and paste the following:

```[javascript]
//require express
var express = require('express')
    //define app as in instance of express
var app = express()
//require body-parser
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')

//use bodyparser as a middle ware
app.use(bodyParser.json())

//ably realtime
const ably = require('ably').Realtime;
const ablyRealtime = new ably('XXX_API_KEY')
const channel = ablyRealtime.channels.get('ably-chat');



//set cors middleware
app.use((req, res, next)=> {
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
    next();
});
//handle sending of message via ably
app.post('/send_message', (req, res)=> {
    var data = {
        user: req.body.name,
        msg: req.body.msg,
        action: req.body.action
    }
    channel.publish('data', data, (err)=> {
        if (err) {
            console.log('publish failed with error ' + err);
        } else {
            console.log('publish succeeded ' + data.msg);
        }
    })
    res.send({ status: 'okay', data: data });

});

//listen on port and serve the app
app.listen(3000, ()=> {
    console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
```
"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/c5e72695fa28a10df4c8e68c4e6234688bf27b50

The code block above is our Express API server setup. 

At the beginning of the file, you had required Express, Body-parser and Ably libraries for Node.js respectively. 
Next, you created a new Ably object, passing in your API Key.
Next, you set the CORS header to your request, using a middleware function.
Finally, you create a post handler for the @/@ route, and we then make  @Ably@ publish to a channel called @ably-chat@ with an event called @message@.
Note both the channel name and the event name used on this server. The channel name will be subscribed to while you will listen to the event in your React Native app.
This is all we need on the server side for your API call to work.

Next, start up your API by running:

```[sh]
node server.js
```

h2.
  default: Step 3 - Building The React Native Application


To get started, create a new file called @chat.js@ and add paste in the following:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native'
export default class Chat extends Component<{}> {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',
    paddingTop: 10,
  },
});
```

In the code above, nothing much is happening. It is a blank page which you will use to hold your chat component later on.

Next, Open @App.js@ and replace content with:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Chat from "./Chat";
import { StyleSheet, View, Text, TextInput, Button, AsyncStorage } from "react-native";

export default class App extends Component<{}> {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { txt: "", user: null };
    this.handler = this.handler.bind(this);
  }

  componentDidMount = () => {
    AsyncStorage.getItem("user")
      .then(value => {
        this.setState({ user: value });
      })
      .done();
  };
  submitName = () => {
    AsyncStorage.setItem("user", this.state.txt);
    this.setState({ user: this.state.txt });
  };

  handler = () => {
    this.setState({
      user: null
    });
  };
  getRender = () => {
    if (this.state.user != null) {
      return <Chat handler={this.handler} />;
    } else {
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text style={{ alignItems: "center" }}>
            Please Give us a name to join the chat with
          </Text>
          <View
            style={{
              flexWrap: "wrap",
              alignItems: "center",
              flexDirection: "row"
            }}
          >
            <TextInput
              value={this.state.txt}
              style={{ width: "80%" }}
              placeholder="Enter Your message!"
              onChangeText={txt => this.setState({ txt })}
            />

            <Button
              style={{ width: "20%" }}
              onPress={this.submitName}
              title="Send"
              color="#841584"
            />
          </View>
        </View>
      );
    }
  };

  render = ()=> {
    return this.getRender();
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    backgroundColor: "#F5FCFF"
  }
});
```

If you look at the code above, these are the differences between the original @App.js@ file and this new one.

Above, you have imported React Native UI component (View, Text, Button, TextInput, StyleSheet) to help us with our UI styling. Also, you imported @AsyncStorage@, which you will use to store items on the device.

In the constructor, you declared a constructor passing in @props@, called the super constructor of the @props@. You declared two items in your state assignment namely @txt@ and @user@. Finally, you made a new assignment called @handler@ to a function named @handler@ which you will define soon.

Next, you defined the @componentDidMount@ method which @React@ will fire once the component is mounted. In this method, you used the @AsyncStorage@ component to check if a value exists and if it does, set the state of user to that value.

In the @submitName@ method, you used @AsyncStorage@ to set the value of @user@ which you are checking for in the @componentDidMount@ method to the value of the current @txt@ state.

Just after the @submitName@ method, you defined the @handler@ method assigned in the constructor. In this method, you set the state of @user@ to null. Why have we done this?  Is it needed? You will find out in the next method called @getRender@

In the @getRender@ function, you first check if the @user@ state is not null, then return the @Chat@ component which is still empty for now. If the @user@ state is null, it means the user is yet to select a user name. If the @user@ state is null, it presents them with a form to enter their user name.

Take a look at the form returned when there is no username, you will notice:

# The presence of a @TextInput@ whose value is set to the @txt@ state and the @onChangeText@ event alters the @txt@ state
# The presence of a @Button@ whose @onPress@ event fires the @submitName@ event you had defined earlier.

If you run the app, you will be presented with a screen that shows a text input and button prompting you to set a username.  

<a href="/images/tutorials/react-native-pubsub/react_login.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/react-native-pubsub/react_login.png" style="width: 50%" alt="enter username screenshot">
</a>

However, if you set a username now, you will be presented with an empty page, as you have not created the chat component yet. Open @chat.js@ and replace the content with:

```[javascript]
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, View, AsyncStorage } from "react-native";

var Realtime = require("ably").Realtime;
var ably, channel;

export default class Chat extends Component<{}> {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      user: "",
      msg: [],
      txt: "",
      usersCount: 0
    };
  }

  componentDidMount = () => {
    AsyncStorage.getItem("user")
      .then(value => {
        this.setState({ user: value });
        this.subscribe();
      })
      .done();
  };

  render = () => {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
      </View>
    );
  };
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: "#F5FCFF",
    paddingTop: 10
  };
});
```

If you look at the code above, these are the differences between the former @chat.js@ file and this new one.

Above, we imported @AsyncStorage@, which we will use to store and retrieve items on the device. Also, we required the @Ably@ Realtime library and declared two new variables namely @Ably@ and @channel@.

In the constructor, we passed in @props@, called the super constructor of the @props@. we then declared some items in the state assignment namely @msg@, @txt@, @user@ and @usersCount@.

Next, we defined the @componentDidMount@ method which @React@ will fire once the component is mounted. In this method, we used the @AsyncStorage@ component to check if a value exists and if it does, set the state of @user@ to that value. Also, we called the @subscribe@  function which we will treat soon.

Here is what our subscribe function looks like:

```[javascript]
  subscribe = () => {
    ably = new Realtime({
      key: "XXX_API_KEY",
      clientId: this.state.user
    });
    channel = ably.channels.get("ably-chat");
    channel.presence.subscribe("enter", member => {
      var data = {
        msg: "joined the chat",
        user: member.clientId,
        action: "joined"
      };

      var newmsg = this.state.msg;

      newmsg.push(data);

      channel.presence.get((err, members) => {
        this.setState({ msg: newmsg, usersCount: members.length });
      });
    });

    channel.presence.subscribe("leave", member => {
      var data = {
        msg: "left the chat",
        user: member.clientId,
        action: "left"
      };

      var newmsg = this.state.msg;

      newmsg.push(data);

      channel.presence.get((err, members) => {
        this.setState({ msg: newmsg, usersCount: members.length });
      });
    });

    channel.presence.enter();

    channel.subscribe("message", msg => {
      var newmsg = this.state.msg;

      newmsg.push(msg.data);

      this.setState({ msg: newmsg, txt: "" });
    });
  };
```
"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/a5dbd17076cb80fcf12a3ee0178b1e4868b00a5c

The @subscribe@ method is where all Realtime subscriptions such as @presence@ and @subscribe@ are made. Let’s look at what goes on in this method.

# First, you set the @Ably@ variable to an instance of the Realtime library passing in your API Key and the current user. The reason for putting in the current user is because you want to access presence events.
# You subscribed to a channel called @ably-chat@.
# You subscribed to @enter@ presence events by registering a callback that is invoked whenever a new member has entered the channel. Also, you get the number of users in the chat room after a new user joins.
# You subscribed to the presence event of @leave@ by registering a callback that is invoked whenever a member has left the channel. Also, you get the number of current users in the chat room after a user leaves the chat.
# You made a call to @channel.presence.enter()@ which triggers the entry into the presence event of the channel been listened to.
# Next, a normal subscription is made to the @message@ event which emits Realtime chat messages, and the message is added to the array of messages available and displayed in Realtime.

Next, we will treat a @load_message@ function which does the actual display of our chat messages: 

```[javascript]

  load_messages = () => {
    var chat = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < this.state.msg.length; i++) {
      if (this.state.msg[i].action == "joined") {
        chat.push(
          <Text style={{ padding: 3 }} key={i}>
            {this.state.msg[i].user} {this.state.msg[i].msg}
          </Text>
        );
      } else if (this.state.msg[i].action == "left") {
        chat.push(
          <Text style={{ padding: 3 }} key={i}>
            {this.state.msg[i].user} {this.state.msg[i].msg}
          </Text>
        );
      } else if (this.state.msg[i].user == this.state.user) {
        chat.push(
          <View
            key={i}
            style={{
              width: "auto",
              backgroundColor: "rgb(244, 226, 96)",
              alignSelf: "flex-start",
              padding: 10,
              borderRadius: 25,
              marginBottom: 5
            }}
            >
            <Text> {this.state.msg[i].msg}  </Text>
          </View>
        );
      } else {
        chat.push(
          <View key={i}>
            <View
              style={{
                width: "auto",
                backgroundColor: "rgb(125, 185, 232)",
                alignSelf: "flex-end",
                padding: 10,
                borderRadius: 25
              }}
              >
              <Text> {this.state.msg[i].msg}{" "}
              </Text>
            </View>
            <Text
              style={{
                width: "auto",
                alignSelf: "flex-end",
                paddingRight: 10,
                marginBottom: 5,
                fontSize: 6
              }}
              >
              {this.state.msg[i].user}
            </Text>
          </View>
        );
      }
    }
    return chat;
  };
```

In the @load_message@ function, a lot of things are going on here, but what the function primarily does is to loop through the messages, check for the action of the messages, and apply either the chat style or notification style to the messages. For example, messages from the presence event @leave@ and @enter@ have the same styling, while messages from the @message@ event have a chat bubble style. Also, the loop checks for the user who sent the message and floats the message to the appropriate position. For example, messages sent from you will be floated to the left, while other users messages would be floated to the right. 

Please note that you need to change the import of components from React Native to contain the @Text@ component used in the @load_message@ function as seen below:

```[javascript]
import { StyleSheet, View, Text, AsyncStorage } from "react-native";
```

Next, we define a function which handles submission of chat messages to our server:

```[javascript]
  submitChat = () => {
    if (this.state.txt != "") {
      fetch("XXX_API_ROUTE/send_message", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          Accept: "application/json",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          msg: this.state.txt,
          name: this.state.user,
          action: "chat"
        })
      })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(responseJson => { })
        .catch(error => {
          console.error(error);
        });
    }
  };
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/ea00227e4f3d449b488737ded1da922c65686be8

p(tip). Note: If you use IP address such as @127.0.0.1@ or @localhost@, the request is most likely going to fail. This is because, in React Native, @localhost@ or @127.0.0.1@ refers to the internal application. Please use the network IP for your system instead To find the IP for your system, please visit this "link":https://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-IP-Address-of-Your-PC.

In the @submitChat@ function, you trigger a @POST@ request to our API which in turns publishes the message to the right channel and event. You used the @fetch@ API provided by React Native to send an AJAX request to our server which we created earlier.

Wouldn't it be nice to allow users a chance to leave the chat room using a button? Yes, it will. Next, we will define a leave chat function:

```[javascript]
  leaveChat = () => {
    AsyncStorage.removeItem("user");
    channel.presence.leave();
    this.setState({ user: "" });
    this.props.handler();
  };
```

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/b0fcc06042e9dd0556b36042c85fc2b29ce5404d
 
In the @leaveChat@ function, you used the @AsyncStorage@ @remove@ method to remove the @user@ key from the device, leave the presence event by calling @channel.presence.leave()@. Next, you set the @user@ state to an empty string and also call the @handler@ method which has been passed to the chat component as a prop from the @App@ component.

Finally, let's alter our @render@ function to do some justice to our code:

```[javascript]
  render = () => {
    chatMessages = this.load_messages();
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <View
          style={{
            alignItems: "center",
            flexDirection: "row",
            top: 0,
            marginBottom: 5
          }}
          >
          <Button
            style={{ width: "40%" }}
            onPress={this.leaveChat}
            title="Leave Chat"
            color="#841584"
            />
          <Text>{this.state.usersCount} member(s) active</Text>
        </View>
        <ScrollView>

          {chatMessages}

        </ScrollView>
        <View
          style={{
            flexWrap: "wrap",
            alignItems: "flex-start",
            flexDirection: "row",
            position: "absolute",
            bottom: 0
          }}
          >
          <TextInput
            value={this.state.txt}
            style={{ width: "80%" }}
            placeholder="Enter Your message!"
            disabled={this.state.user == ""}
            onChangeText={txt => this.setState({ txt }) }
            />

          <Button
            style={{ width: "20%" }}
            onPress={this.submitChat}
            title="Send"
            color="#841584"
            />
        </View>

In our render statement, the @chatMessages@ variable was rendered, so it can display its content. Also, notice there is have a @text input@ and a @button@.
The text input text is used to set the @txt@ state any time the text changes using the @onChangeText@ event of the button. Notice that our button also calls the @submitChat@ function anytime it is pressed by binding it to its @onPress@ function.

import { StyleSheet, Text, View, TextInput, Button, ScrollView, AsyncStorage } from "react-native";
```
