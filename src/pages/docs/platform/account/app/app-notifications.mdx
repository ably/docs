Configure and manage push notifications for your Ably application to deliver messages to mobile devices and web browsers.

Push notifications enable your application to reach users even when they're not actively using your app, providing critical updates and real-time alerts.

## Accessing notification management

To manage push notifications for your application:

1. Navigate to your application dashboard
2. Click the Notifications tab
3. Configure push notification settings and test delivery

## Push notification overview

### What are push notifications

Push notifications allow you to:

- Reach inactive users - Send messages when your app isn't running
- Deliver critical updates - Ensure important information reaches users
- Re-engage users - Bring users back to your application

// iOS device registration example
const deviceDetails = {
  id: 'device-unique-id',
  platform: 'ios',
  formFactor: 'phone',
  metadata: {
    deviceType: 'iPhone12,1'
  }
};

const recipient = {
  deviceToken: 'apns-device-token',
  deviceId: 'device-unique-id'
};

await ably.push.admin.deviceRegistrations.save(deviceDetails, recipient);
```
</Code>

- Topic-based - Subscribe to content categories or interests
- Geographic - Subscribe based on location or region
- Role-based - Subscribe based on user roles or permissions

## Publishing push notifications

### Creating push payloads

Publish messages with push notification data:

<Code>
```javascript
// Publish with push notification
await channel.publish('news-update', {
  title: 'Breaking News',
  content: 'Important news content here'
}, {
  push: {
    notification: {
      title: 'Breaking News Alert',
      body: 'Tap to read important news update'
    },
    data: {
      newsId: '12345',
      category: 'breaking'
    }
  }
});
```
</Code>

### Platform-specific payloads

Customize notifications for each platform:

#### iOS notification format

```json
{
  "aps": {
    "alert": {
      "title": "Notification Title",
      "body": "Notification message"
    },
    "badge": 1,
    "sound": "default"
  },
  "custom": "data"
}
```

#### Android notification format

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Notification Title",
    "body": "Notification message",
    "icon": "ic_notification"
  },
  "data": {
    "custom": "data"
  }
}
```

### Notification targeting

Control who receives notifications:

| Targeting Method | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Channel-based | All devices subscribed to a channel |
| Device-specific | Specific device tokens or IDs |
| User-based | All devices belonging to specific users |
| Conditional | Based on device metadata or user attributes |

## Testing push notifications

### Push inspector tool

Use the built-in testing tool:
