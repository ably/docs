As part of "Webhooks":/integrations/webhooks, it is possible to integrate with various systems.

"AWS Lambda Functions":https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/ provide event-driven serverless compute functions which allow users to easily run code whenever events are sent to it. These can be very useful for integrating into various other AWS systems.
