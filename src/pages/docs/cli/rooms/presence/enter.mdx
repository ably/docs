When you enter the presence set of a channel using the CLI, you'll see a list of members currently present.

The actions associated with each event are:

| ------ | ----------- |
| Enter | A client has entered the presence set. |
| Update | A client has updated their presence data. |
| Leave | A client has left the presence set. |
