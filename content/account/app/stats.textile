h2(#chart). Statistics chart

The Stats page also includes a chart that visualizes your app's data over time:

</a>

The following explains how to use the statistics chart:

- *Duration* := Define a specific time range for the statistics you want to view. This enables you to focus on periods of particular interest. For example, set the time range from "2024-06-17 00:00" to "2024-08-06 11:18" to analyze data within that period.
- *Zoom* := Use preset zoom options (1h, 8h, 24h, 7d, 1m, 6m, 1y, all) to adjust the chart's view to different periods, enabling you to analyze data at various granularities.
