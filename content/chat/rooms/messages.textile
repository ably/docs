Send, update, delete, and receive messages in a chat room with any number of participants. Users subscribe to messages by registering a listener, and send messages to all users that are subscribed to receive them.
A user can also update or delete a message, all users that are subscribed to the room will be notified of the changes.

h2(#subscribe). Subscribe to messages

blang[javascript,swift,kotlin].
  Subscribe to receive messages in a room by registering a listener. Use the <span lang="javascript">"@messages.subscribe()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Messages.html#subscribe</span><span lang="swift">"@messages.subscribe()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-swift/main/AblyChat/documentation/ablychat/messages/subscribe%28%29-360z1</span><span lang="kotlin">"@messages.subscribe()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-kotlin/main/dokka/chat-android/com.ably.chat/-messages/subscribe.html</span> method in a room to receive all messages that are sent to it:

blang[react].
    Subscribe to messages with the "@useMessages@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/functions/chat-react.useMessages.html hook. Supply a listener and the hook will automatically subscribe to message events sent to the room. As long as a defined value is provided, the subscription will persist across renders. If the listener value is undefined, the subscription will be removed until it becomes defined again.

    Providing a listener will also enable you to retrieve messages that have been "previously sent to the room.":/docs/chat/rooms/history

```[javascript]
const {unsubscribe} = room.messages.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log(event.message);
});
```

```[react]
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useMessages } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  useMessages({
    listener: (event) => {
      console.log('Received message: ', event.message);
    },
  });

  return <div>...</div>;
};
```

```[swift]
let messagesSubscription = try await room.messages.subscribe()
for await message in messagesSubscription {
    print("Message received: \(message)")
}
```

```[kotlin]
val subscription = room.messages.subscribe { messageEvent: MessageEvent ->
    println(messageEvent.message.toString())
}
```

h3(#structure). Message structure

The following is the structure of a message:

```[json]
{
  "serial": "01826232498871-001@abcdefghij:001",
  "clientId": "basketLover014",
  "roomId": "basketball-stream",
  "text": "What a shot!",
  "headers": {},
  "metadata": {},
  "createdAt": new Date("2024-06-12T11:37:59.988Z"),
  "action": "message.create",
  "version": "01826232498871-001@abcdefghij:001",
  "timestamp": new Date("2024-06-12T11:37:59.988Z"),
  "operation": {},
}
```

The following are the properties of a message:

|_. Property |_. Description |_. Type |
| serial | An Ably-generated ID used to uniquely identify the message. By comparing it to others it provides a deterministic global ordering of messages. | String |
| clientId | The client identifier of the user that created the message. | String |
| roomId | The name of the room the message was created in. | String |
| text | The message contents. | String |
| headers | Optional headers for adding additional information to a message, such as the relative timestamp of a livestream video, or flagging a message as important. Do not use the headers for authoritative information. There is no server-side validation. When reading headers treat them like user input. | Object |
| metadata | Optional additional metadata about the message, such as animations, effects or links to other resources such as images. This information is not read by Ably. Do not use metadata for authoritative information. There is no server-side validation. When reading metadata treat it like user input. | Object |
| createdAt | The time the message was created. | Date |
| action | The latest action performed on this message, such as @message.create@, @message.update@ or @message.delete@.  | String |
| version | An Ably-generated ID used to uniquely identify the version of the message. It provides a deterministic global ordering of message versions. The @version@ is identical to @serial@ if the action is @message.create@.  | String |
| timestamp | The time the action was performed. It will be identical to @createdAt@ if the action is a @message.create@. | Date |
| operation | For updates and deletions, this provides additional details about the action. It may contain the following properties: | Object or undefined |
| | clientId: The client identifier of the user associated with the action. | String or undefined |
| | description: Optional description for the action. | String or undefined |
| | metadata: Optional additional metadata about the action. | Object or undefined |

See "below":#global-ordering for more information on how to apply deterministic global ordering to the chat messages in your application.

h3(#unsubscribe). Unsubscribe from messages

blang[javascript].
  Use the @unsubscribe()@ function returned in the @subscribe()@ response to remove a chat message listener:

blang[swift].
  You don't need to handle removing listeners, as this is done automatically by the SDK.

blang[kotlin].
  Use the @unsubscribe()@ method on the returned subscription to remove a chat message listener:

blang[react].
  When you unmount the component that is using the @useMessages@ hook, it will automatically handle unsubscribing any associated listeners registered to receive messages.

blang[javascript,kotlin].
  ```[javascript]
  // Initial subscription
  const { unsubscribe } = room.messages.subscribe((event) => console.log(event.message));

  // To remove the listener
  unsubscribe();
  ```

  ```[kotlin]
  subscription.unsubscribe()
  ```

blang[react,swift].

blang[javascript].
  Use the "@messages.unsubscribeAll()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Messages.html#unsubscribeAll method to deregister all chat message listeners in a room:

  ```[javascript]
  await room.messages.unsubscribeAll();
  ```

blang[react,swift,kotlin].

blang[javascript].

  <aside data-type='note'>
  <p>There is a difference between unsubscribing from messages and detaching from a room that is important to understand. </p>
  <p>Messages are sent to users as soon as they "attach":/docs/chat/rooms#attach to a room, irrespective of whether a listener has been registered by calling @subscribe()@. Calling @unsubscribe()@ only deregisters the listener.</p>
  <p>The "@detach()@":/docs/chat/rooms#detach method detaches a user from the room. At that point a user will no longer receive any messages that are sent to the room.</p>
  </aside>

blang[react,swift,kotlin].

h2(#send). Send a message

blang[javascript,swift,kotlin].
  Use the <span lang="javascript">"@messages.send()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Messages.html#send</span><span lang="swift">"@messages.send()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-swift/main/AblyChat/documentation/ablychat/messages/send%28params%3A%29</span><span lang="kotlin">"@messages.send()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-kotlin/main/dokka/chat-android/com.ably.chat/-messages/send.html</span> method to send a message in a chat room. All users that are "subscribed":#subscribe to messages on that room will receive it:

blang[react].
  Use the "@send()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-react.UseMessagesResponse.html#send method available from the response of the @useMessages@ hook to send a message to the room:

```[javascript]
await room.messages.send({text: 'hello'});
```

```[react]
import { useMessages } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { send } = useMessages();

  const handleMessageSend = () => {
    send({ text: 'Hello, World!' });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleMessageSend}>Send Message</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```[swift]
let message = try await room.messages.send(params: .init(text: "hello"))
```

```[kotlin]
room.messages.send(text = "hello")
```

h2(#update). Update a message

<aside data-type='new'>
<p>Message updates were added in version 0.3 for the JavaScript and React SDKs, and version 0.2 for the Kotlin and Swift SDKs.</p>
</aside>

blang[javascript,swift,kotlin].
  Use the <span lang="javascript">"@messages.update()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Messages.html#update</span><span lang="swift">"@messages.update()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-swift/main/AblyChat/documentation/ablychat/messages/update%28newmessage:description:metadata:%29</span><span lang="kotlin">"@messages.update()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-kotlin/main/dokka/chat-android/com.ably.chat/-messages/update.html</span> method to update a message in a chat room. All users that are "subscribed":#subscribe to messages on that room will receive the update:

blang[react].
  Use the "@update()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_react.UseMessagesResponse.html#update method available from the response of the @useMessages@ hook to update a message in the room:

```[javascript]
import { Message } from '@ably/chat';
const message: Message
const updatedMessage = message.copy({text: "my updated text"})
await room.messages.update(updatedMessage, { description: "Message update by user" });
```

```[react]
import { Message } from '@ably/chat';
import { useMessages } from '@ably/chat/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { update } = useMessages();
  const [message, setMessage] = useState<Message>();

  const handleMessageUpdate = (msg: Message) => {
    update(msg.copy({ text: "my updated text" }), { description: "Message update by user" })
    .then((updatedMsg: Message) => {
      console.log('Message updated:', updatedMsg);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error updating message: ', error);
    });
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => handleMessageUpdate(message)}>Update Message</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```[swift]
let originalMessage: Message
let updatedMessage = try await room.messages.update(
  newMessage: originalMessage.copy(text: "my updated text"),
  description: "Message update by user",
  metadata: nil

```

```[kotlin]
val originalMessage: Message
val updatedMessage = room.messages.update(
  originalMessage.copy(text = "my updated text"),
  operationDescription = "Message update by user",

To filter for updated messages, provide a listener that checks the <span lang="javascript">@type@</span><span lang="swift">@action@</span><span lang="kotlin">@type@</span> property of the message event:

blang[react].
  Use the "@useMessages@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/functions/chat_react.useMessages.html hook to subscribe to messages in a room. To filter for updated messages, provide a listener that checks the @type@ property of the message event:

h3(#update-structure). Message update structure

The following is the structure of an updated message:

```[json]
{
  "serial": "01726232498871-001@abcdefghij:001",
  "clientId": "basketLover014",
  "roomId": "basketball-stream",
  "text": "What a shot! Edit: I meant to say 'What a dunk!'",
  "headers": {},
  "metadata": {},
  "createdAt": new Date("2024-06-12T11:37:59.988Z")S,
  "action": "message.update",
  "version": "01826232498871-001@abcdefghij:001",

  "operation": {
    "clientId": "basketLover014",
    "description": "Message updated by client",
    "metadata": {}

```

The updated message response is identical to the structure of a message, with the following differences:

|_. Property |_. Description |
| action | Set to @message.update@. |
| version | Set to the serial of the update action. |

h3(#deletion-structure). Message deletion structure

The following is the structure of a deleted message:

```[json]
{
  "serial": "01726232498871-001@abcdefghij:001",
  "clientId": "basketLover014",
  "roomId": "basketball-stream",
  "text": "What a shot!",
  "headers": {},
  "metadata": {},
  "createdAt": new Date("2024-06-12T11:37:59.988Z"),
  "action": "message.delete",
  "version": "01826232498871-001@abcdefghij:001",
  "timestamp": new Date("2024-11-21T15:49:25.425Z"),
  "operation": {
    "clientId": "basketLover014",
    "description": "Message deleted by client",
    "metadata": {}
  },
}
```

The deleted message response is identical to the structure of a message, with the following differences:

|_. Property |_. Description |
| action | Set to @message.delete@. |
| version | Set to the serial of the deletion action. |
| timestamp | Set to the time the message was deleted. |
| operation | Set to the details the actioning client provided in the request. |

h2(#global-ordering). Ordering chat message events

Chat messages and update events are delivered in realtime to clients connected to a particular region in the order in which that region receives them. The order in which a given region receives these events may be different from the "global" order of events, i.e. the true time-based order in which events happened.

Chat messages are uniquely identified by their @serial@ and may have multiple @versions@ as a result of edit and delete operations. Both @serial@ and @version@ are lexicographically sortable strings. This means they can be used to enforce a deterministic global ordering based on string comparison.

h3(#ordering-new). Ordering New Messages

If the @serial@ of one message occurs before another when lexicographically sorted, the first message is considered to have occurred before the other. If the @serial@ values are identical, the messages are the same message.

The @Message@ object also has convenience methods "@before@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Message.html#before, "@after@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Message.html#after and "@equal@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Message.html#equal which provide the same comparison.

h3(#ordering-update-delete). Ordering Updates and Deletes

Applying an action to a message produces a new version, which is uniquely identified by the @version@ property. When two message instances share the same @serial@ they represent the same chat message, but they can represent different versions. Lexicographically sorting the two message instances by the @version@ property gives the global order of the message versions: the message instance with a greater @version@ is newer, the message instance with a lower @version@ is older, and if their @version@ is equal then they are the same version.

The @Message@ object also has convenience methods "@isOlderVersionOf@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Message.html#isolderversionof, "@isNewerVersionOf@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Message.html#isnewerversionof and "@isSameVersionAs@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat-js.Message.html#issameversionas which provide the same comparison.

Update and Delete events provide the full message payload, so may be used to replace the entire earlier version of the message.
