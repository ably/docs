The Rules section in your Ably dashboard enables you to enforce settings and configure features for channels, rooms, or spaces within specified namespaces. Configure and manage your rules in the [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/settings/rules) under the Rules section. Rules provide granular control over message persistence, authentication requirements, security settings, and advanced functionality across your application.

## Rules overview <a id="overview"/>

Rules are used to enforce settings including message persistence, authentication, and TLS for all channels, rooms, or spaces within the specified namespace. This allows you to apply consistent configurations across groups of channels without having to configure each one individually.

## Your rules <a id="your-rules"/>

The rules interface displays your configured namespace rules and their applied settings:

### Channel namespace configuration <a id="namespace-configuration"/>

Each rule is defined by a channel namespace pattern that determines which channels the rule applies to:

| Configuration element | Description | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Channel namespace | The namespace pattern for the rule | Define which channels the rule applies to |
| Example match | Sample channel names that match the pattern | Understand rule scope and application |

For example, a namespace `coco` would apply to channels matching the pattern, with example matches like `coco:data` or `coco`.

## Available features <a id="features"/>

The rules system provides access to multiple feature categories that can be enabled for your namespaces:

### Message persistence features <a id="persistence-features"/>

| Feature | Description | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Persist last message | Store the most recent message published to channels | The last message published on a channel will be stored for 365 days |
| Persist all messages | Store all messages published to channels | All messages on a channel will be stored for a minimum of 24 hours |

### Security and access features <a id="security-features"/>

| Feature | Description | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Identified | Require client identification for channel access | Clients will not be permitted to use (including to attach, publish, or subscribe) any channels within this namespace unless they are identified |
| TLS only | Enforce encrypted connections for channel access | Only clients that are connected using TLS will be permitted to subscribe to any channels within this namespace |

### Push notification features <a id="push-features"/>

| Feature | Description | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Push notifications | Enable push notification delivery | Publishing messages with a push payload in the extras field is permitted and can trigger the delivery of a native push notification to registered devices for the channel |

### Message processing features <a id="processing-features"/>

| Feature | Description | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Message interactions | Enable message references and threading | Messages will contain a unique timeserial field that may be used in typed references between messages |
| Server-side batching | Enable message batching optimization | Channels within this namespace will start batching inbound messages instead of sending them out immediately to subscribers as per the configured policy |
| Message conflation | Enable message optimization | Channels within this namespace will aggregate inbound messages and process them for conflation before delivering them to subscribers, as per the configured conflation expression |
