# Error 50410: Edge proxy gateway timeout

## What Happened

Ably's edge proxy service (CloudFront) timed out waiting for a response from the Ably platform within the expected timeframe.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 50410 | 504 | Server Error (Edge Proxy) | Yes - temporary network or platform issue |

## Quick Fix

- Your request will be automatically retried by Ably SDKs with appropriate backoff
- Check [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) if the error persists beyond 2 minutes
- No immediate action required for isolated occurrences

## Error Messages

You may see this message:
- "Ably's edge proxy service timed out waiting for the Ably platform"

## Common Causes

1. **Temporary platform load** (60% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50410-knowledge.md lines 40-44 -->
   - Platform service processing delays during high traffic
   - Temporary resource constraints in specific regions
   
2. **Network connectivity issues** (30% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50410-knowledge.md lines 40-44 -->
   - Transient network problems between edge proxy and platform
   - Regional connectivity disruptions
   
3. **Rare platform incidents** (10% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50410-knowledge.md lines 127-130 -->
   - Service disruptions affecting request processing
   - Regional service degradation

## Resolution Steps

1. **For transient errors (most cases)**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50410-knowledge.md lines 46-50 -->
   - Ably SDKs automatically retry with exponential backoff
   - No manual intervention required unless persistent
   
2. **For persistent errors (lasting >2 minutes)**
   - Check the [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) for any ongoing incidents
   - Review your recent traffic patterns for unusual spikes
   - Note the time and region where errors occurred
   
3. **If errors continue after status check**
   - Try connecting through a different network path if possible
   - Collect error timestamps and request IDs for support

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically retry 504 gateway timeout errors with exponential backoff. The SDK will handle the retry logic transparently, and your application will receive the response once the platform becomes available.
<!-- Source: Based on Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection#connection-state-recovery and error category behavior -->

## Code Examples

Since this is an infrastructure-level error handled automatically by SDKs, no specific code changes are required. The SDKs handle retries transparently:

```javascript
// SDKs automatically handle 504 errors with retry logic
const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ key: apiKey });

// Your normal publishing code - retries happen automatically
channel.publish('update', data, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    // Only persistent failures reach here after automatic retries
    console.error('Failed after retries:', err);
  }
});
```
<!-- Code source: Standard Ably error handling pattern from https://ably.com/docs/realtime/channels#publish -->

## Prevention

While this error is typically caused by infrastructure-level issues outside your direct control, you can minimize impact by:

- Implementing request batching to reduce the number of individual requests
- Using Ably's regional endpoints if available for your use case
- Monitoring your application's request patterns to avoid sudden traffic spikes

## Performance Impact

This error indicates a temporary delay but doesn't affect:
- Existing WebSocket connections (they remain active)
- Messages already in transit
- Other channels or operations

The error only impacts the specific HTTP request that timed out.
