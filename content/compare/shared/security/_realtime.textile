Realtime.co provides security through an authentication process. To authenticate a user you send a token to the server which grants the authenticated user read/write permissions to a specific channel. The limit is 100 authenticated channels per user token. Realtime.co also supports using TLS for stronger security. To use this type of connection you simply replace the path */server/2.1* with */server/ssl/2.1* in your Realtime Messaging Cluster URL, as shown below:
