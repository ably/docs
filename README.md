## Support

## Website Proxy

The Website app forwards requests to `/docs` to the `docs.ably.com` site.

Asset prefixing is applied only during the app build process and is not available in the dev version.

To ensure proper setup in your local:

1. Set the `ASSET_PREFIX=http://localhost:9000` variable in your environment.
2. Add `DOCS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9000` to your `.env` file in the root of the Website app.
3. Ensure that `.env.production` exists in the app root for the Yarn build to function correctly.
4. You should be able to view the content and toggle between signed in and signed-out states.
