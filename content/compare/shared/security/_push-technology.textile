h5(#security-push). Push Technology

Push Technology is secured using a role-based model where permissions control actions performed on the server by client sessions. They offer a Unified API "AuthenticationControl":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000029535 feature which allows a control client session to authenticate other client sessions. This is done by sending a principal and a password to the server, which is either granted or denied.

All Push Technology transport protocols support TLS. To ensure passwords and session tokens are not transferred in the clear, TLS is recommended to protect all communication with the server.
