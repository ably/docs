This error occurs when a client cancels a request before it completes.

| Error code | HTTP status code | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 49900 | 499 | Client Cancellation | No |

## Impact

This error indicates the client terminated the request:
- The operation was not completed on the server
- No server-side error occurred
- The cancellation was initiated by the client

This is expected behavior when clients cancel operations and typically doesn't require any corrective action.

## Troubleshooting

{/* Source: Knowledge base general scenarios from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/49900-knowledge.md lines 6-21 */}

### User navigation or app backgrounding

This occurs when:
- User navigates away from the page
- Mobile app is backgrounded
- User manually cancels an operation

This is expected behavior and doesn't indicate a problem. The client application should handle cancellation gracefully and clean up any resources.

### Client timeout

This occurs when:
- A request exceeds the client's configured timeout
- Network interruption causes timeout
- Connection is lost during the operation

To resolve this:
- Review your client timeout settings
- Ensure they accommodate expected operation duration
- Consider network conditions when setting timeouts

### Graceful shutdown

This occurs when:
- The client application is shutting down
- The SDK is being disposed
- Clean disconnect is initiated

This is normal behavior during application termination. Ensure your application properly disposes of Ably client instances.

## Limited information available

This error code is primarily used internally within Ably's infrastructure for ZeroRPC communication. Based on internal discussions, this error shouldn't typically be exposed to client applications.

If you're seeing this error in your application, it may indicate:
- An unusual condition in the connection handling
- A temporary issue with request processing

This error code has limited documentation available. If you encounter this error persistently, please contact Ably support at https://ably.com/support with:
- The full error message
- What action triggered the error
- Your account ID and app ID
- The SDK and version you're using

Our support team will help you resolve this issue.

## Need further help?

Contact [Ably support](https://ably.com/support) if you're still experiencing issues after trying the steps listed above.

You'll need to provide:
