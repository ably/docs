## Cost breakdown

The following breakdown shows the cost of connections, channels and messages in this scenario.

### How messages are counted

Messages are billed when sent to Ably and when delivered to subscribers. Usage is billed in increments of one million messages, rounded up.

One vitals reading sent to 5 care coordinators = 6 messages (one sent to Ably + 5 delivered to coordinators).

#### Messages generated by this scenario

| Vitals (sent)          | 100 patients × 6/min × 480 mins × 22 days    | 6,336,000  |
| Vitals (delivered)     | 6,336,000 × 5 coordinators                   | 31,680,000 |
| Total messages         | 6,336,000 + 31,680,000                        | **38,016,000** |
