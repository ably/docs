LiveSync Postgres and Models SDK has three key components:

# *Postgres Database connector* that watches changes in your database broadcast those updates over Ably channels.
# *Models SDK* in the frontend that merges changes into your models and supports optimistic updates for the publisher.
# *Pub/Sub* channels that form the mechanism behind the scenes to broadcast updates from the postgres connector to the frontend models.

h2(#postgres-connector). Postgres Database connector

The "Postgres database connector":/postgres-models/postgres-connetor watches for changes in your database and will publish those as messages over Ably channels. The connector is a standalone service that you can "self-host":postgres-models/postgres-connector#self-hosted in your infrastructure. Ably also provides a "hosted version":http://localhost:8000/postgres-models/postgres-connector#hosted-with-ably of the connector that you can use.

The connector makes use of the outbox pattern to track changes in your database. Records that you write to the "outbox table":/postgres-models/postgres-connector#table-schema will be read by the database connector and published as messages to Ably Pub/Sub channels.

h2(#models-sdk). Models SDK

The "Models SDK":/postgres-models/models-sdk is a library that you can include in your frontend application to listen to changes in your database. The SDK will merge those changes into your models and support optimistic updates for the publisher. The SDK is available as a "NPM package":npm-package.
