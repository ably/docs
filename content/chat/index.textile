Chat enables you to build live chat experiences into your applications. Use "Ably's JavaScript SDK":https://github.com/ably/ably-js to implement chat features that function effectively at any scale, whether developing a live streaming chat platform or a 1:1 support chat interface. The features include the following:

- "Channels":/chat/channels := create or join channels of any size, for example, a large-scale live streaming chat, a company group chat, or a 1:1 chat. Channels are the core foundations that enable you to send and receive messages.
- "Replies and Threads":/chat/replies := react to messages by replying directly to them or creating a thread to direct the members to that thread in the channel.
- "Online status":/chat/online-status := display the status of members, whether online or offline, by monitoring when they enter and leave the channel. If the member is online, display when they were last seen as active within the chat application.
- "Reactions":/chat/reactions := react to previously sent messages, for example, giving a heart to a friend's message or giving a thumbs up for a colleague's proposal.
- "Spam protection":/chat/spam-protection := limit member's ability to post messages within a given timeframe with spam protection.
- "Typing indicators":/chat/typing := indicate whether a member is currently typing within the specific channel.

h2(#sdk). Ably SDK

The "Ably JavaScript SDK":/getting-started/setup, with full TypeScript support, enables you to add realtime chat features to an existing application or build a new one from scratch. The SDK enables you to develop your chat application with the features listed above.

You need "authentication":/auth to build realtime features with Ably. There are two types: "basic authentication":/auth/basic for your backend server and "token authentication":/auth/token to generate tokens for your clients' members. "Connection management":/connect enables you to manage the connections for your clients, ensuring they connect before subscribing to channels.
