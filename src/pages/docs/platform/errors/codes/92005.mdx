This error code is currently being used for two completely different purposes: cipher/encryption errors in the Ruby SDK and path not found errors in the LiveObjects REST API.

| Error code | HTTP status code | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 92005 | 400 | Multiple contexts | No |

## Error messages

The following error messages can be returned with error code 92005:

| Message | Context | Description |
| ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| No objects found matching operation path | LiveObjects API | The specified path doesn't match any existing objects. |
| Variable ArgumentError message | Ruby SDK | Invalid arguments passed to cipher encoding (varies based on the specific issue). |

## Impact

This error prevents the current operation from completing. The impact depends on which context triggered the error:

- **LiveObjects context**: The object operation cannot proceed as no objects exist at the specified path.
- **Ruby SDK context**: Message encryption fails and the message cannot be published with encryption.

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried. You must resolve the underlying issue before the operation will succeed.

## Troubleshooting

### Context 1: LiveObjects path not found

| Error message |
| ------------- |
| No objects found matching operation path |

This occurs when:

- Using the LiveObjects REST API with operations like MAP_SET.
- The specified path doesn't exist in the object structure.
- Attempting to update a nested element that hasn't been created yet.

To resolve this:

- Verify the path exists before attempting to update it.
- Create parent objects before setting nested properties.
- Check for typos in your path specification.
- Review the LiveObjects documentation for correct path syntax and operations.

### Context 2: Ruby SDK cipher encoding errors

| Error message |
| ------------- |
| Variable ArgumentError message |

This occurs when:

- Invalid arguments are passed to the cipher encoding method.
- The encryption key format is invalid.
- The key length doesn't match the algorithm requirements.
- The initialization vector (IV) is malformed.
- The message data type is invalid for encryption.

To resolve this:

- Ensure your encryption key is properly formatted and the correct length for your algorithm (e.g., 32 bytes for AES-256).
- Verify the key is properly base64 decoded if stored as base64.
- Check that message data is a string or hash that can be serialized.
- Validate the initialization vector format if providing a custom IV.
- See the [encryption documentation](https://ably.com/docs/channels/options/encryption) for proper cipher configuration.

{/* Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/92005-knowledge.md lines 9-56 */}

<Code>
```ruby
# Ensure valid key format and length
key = Base64.decode64(ENV['CIPHER_KEY_BASE64'])
raise "Invalid key length" unless key.bytesize == 32  # For AES-256

cipher_params = Ably::Util::Crypto.get_default_params(key: key)
```
</Code>

## Known issue

This duplicate usage of error code 92005 is a known issue. The same error code represents:

1. **Ruby SDK**: Cipher/encryption argument validation errors
2. **LiveObjects API**: Path resolution failures in object operations

This creates confusion as completely different problems share the same error code. If you encounter this error, first identify which context applies to your situation based on whether you're using encryption in the Ruby SDK or making LiveObjects API calls.

- Impact: Users receive the same error code for completely different problems
- Recommendation: Assign different error codes to LiveObjects vs cipher errors
- Severity: High - creates significant confusion for developers
*/}
