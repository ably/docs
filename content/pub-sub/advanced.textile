Once you've understood the "basics":/docs/pub-sub of subscribing to a channel and publishing messages to it, you can explore the more advanced concepts and features. This can help you to build more complex and efficient applications.

h2(#subscribe). Subscribing to channels

There are more concepts to understand and more features you can utilize once you've explored the "basics of subscribing":/docs/pub-sub#subscribe to channels.

As a reminder, you can subscribe to all messages on a channel:

```[realtime_javascript]
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime('{{API_KEY}}');
const channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
await channel.subscribe((message) => {
  alert('Received: ' + message.data);
});
```

```[realtime_nodejs]
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime('{{API_KEY}}');
const channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
await channel.subscribe((message) => {
  console.log("Received: " + message.data);
});
```

```[realtime_ruby]
  realtime = Ably::Realtime.new('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  channel.subscribe do |message|
    puts "Received: #{message.data}"
  end
```

```[realtime_python]
  realtime = AblyRealtime('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  def listener(message):
    print('Received ' + message.data)
  await channel.subscribe(listener)
```

```[realtime_java]
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime("{{API_KEY}}");
  Channel channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
  channel.subscribe(new MessageListener() {
    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
      System.out.println("New messages arrived. " + message.name);
    }
  });
```

```[realtime_csharp]
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime("{{API_KEY}}");
  IRealtimeChannel channel = realtime.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
  channel.Subscribe(message => {
    Console.WriteLine($"Message: {message.Name}:{message.Data} received");
  });
```

```[realtime_objc]
ARTRealtime *realtime = [[ARTRealtime alloc] initWithKey:@"{{API_KEY}}"];
ARTRealtimeChannel *channel = [realtime.channels get:@"{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}"];
[channel subscribe:^(ARTMessage *message) {
    NSLog(@"Received: %@", message.data);
}];
```

```[realtime_swift]
let realtime = ARTRealtime(key: "{{API_KEY}}")
let channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
channel.subscribe { message in
    print("Received: \(message.data)")
}
```

```[realtime_flutter]
  final realtime = ably.Realtime(key: '{{API_KEY}}');
  final channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
  final channelMessageSubscription = channel
    .subscribe()
    .listen((ably.Message message) {
      print('Received: ${message.data}');
    }
  );
```

```[realtime_go]
realtime, err := ably.NewRealtime(
  ably.WithKey("{{API_KEY}}"))
channel := realtime.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}

_, err = channel.SubscribeAll(context.Background(), func(msg *ably.Message) {
  fmt.Printf("Received: '%v'\n", msg.Data)
})
```

Or you can subscribe to messages with a specific name:

```[realtime_javascript]
await channel.subscribe('myEvent', (message) => {
  console.log('message received for event ' + message.name);
  console.log('message data:' + message.data);
});
```

```[realtime_nodejs]
await channel.subscribe('myEvent', (message) => {
  console.log('message received for event ' + message.name);
  console.log('message data:' + message.data);
});
```

```[realtime_java]
channel.subscribe("myEvent", new MessageListener() {
  @Override
  public void onMessage(Message message) {
    System.out.println("Message received: " + message.data);
  }
});
```

```[realtime_csharp]
channel.Subscribe("myEvent", message =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"message received for event {message.Name}");
    Console.WriteLine($"message data: {message.Data}");
});
```

```[realtime_ruby]
channel.subscribe('myEvent') do |message|
  puts "message received for event #{message.name}"
  puts "message data: #{message.data}"
end
```

```[realtime_python]
  realtime = AblyRealtime('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  def listener(message):
    print(f'Message received for {message.name}: {message.data}')
  await channel.subscribe('myEvent', listener)
```

```[realtime_swift]
channel.subscribe("myEvent") { message in
    print("message received for event \(message.name)")
    print("message data: \(message.data)")
}
```

```[realtime_objc]
[channel subscribe:@"myEvent" callback:^(ARTMessage *message) {
    NSLog(@"message received for event %@", message.name);
    NSLog(@"message data: %@", message.data);
}];
```

```[realtime_flutter]
final channelMessageSubscription = channel
  .subscribe(name: 'myEvent')
  .listen((ably.Message message) {
    print('message received for event ${message.name}');
    print('message data: ${message.data}');
  }
);
```

```[realtime_go]
_, err = channel.Subscribe(context.Background(), "myEvent", func(msg *ably.Message) {
  fmt.Printf("message received for event: '%v'\n", msg.Name)
  fmt.Printf("message data: '%v'\n", msg.Data)
})
```

h3(#unsubscribe). Unsubscribe from a channel

Unsubscribing from a channel removes previously registered listeners that were added when subscribing to it. You can remove all listeners, or listeners that were registered for only a single event.

Use the "@unsubscribe()@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/channels#unsubscribe method to remove previously registered listeners:

```[realtime_javascript]
/* remove the listener registered for a single event */
channel.unsubscribe('myEvent', myListener);

/* remove the listener registered for all events */
channel.unsubscribe(myListener);
```

```[realtime_nodejs]
/* remove the listener registered for a single event */
channel.unsubscribe('myEvent', myListener);

/* remove the listener registered for all events */
channel.unsubscribe(myListener);
```

```[realtime_java]
/* remove a single listener */
channel.unsubscribe(myListener);

/* remove the listener registered for all events */
channel.unsubscribe("myEvent", myListener);
```

```[realtime_csharp]
/* remove a single listener */
channel.Unsubscribe(myHandler);

/* remove the listener registered for all events */
channel.Unsubscribe("myEvent", myHandler);
```

```[realtime_ruby]
# remove the listener proc registered for a single event
channel.unsubscribe("myEvent", &my_proc)

# remove the listener proc registered for all events
channel.unsubscribe(&my_proc)
```

```[realtime_python]
# remove the listener registered for a single event
channel.unsubscribe('event', listener)

# remove the listener registered for all events
channel.unsubscribe(listener)
```

```[realtime_objc]
// remove the listener registered for a single event
[channel unsubscribe:@"myEvent" listener:listener];

// remove the listener registered for all events
[channel unsubscribe:listener];
```

```[realtime_swift]
// remove the listener registered for a single event
channel.unsubscribe("myEvent", listener: listener)

// remove the listener registered for all events
channel.unsubscribe(listener)
```

```[realtime_flutter]
channelMessageSubscription.cancel();
```

```[realtime_go]
unsubscribe, err := channel.Subscribe(context.Background(), "test-event", func(msg *ably.Message) {
  log.Println("Received message:", msg)
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

unsubscribe()
```

h3(#attach-subscribe). Attaching versus subscribing

Messages are streamed to clients as soon as they attach to a channel, as long as they have the @subscribe@ "capability":/docs/auth/capabilities for it. This is independent of whether or not they have subscribed to the channel.

Subscribing to a channel only registers a listener, or function, client-side that is called each time a message is received. This means that Ably is unaware of whether or not a client is subscribed to a channel.

Channels are not pre-configured or provisioned by Ably in advance. They are created on demand when clients "attach":/docs/channels/states#attach to them, and remain active until there are no remaining clients attached. Attaching to a channel is an action that happens implicitly when a client subscribes to it.

The following is an example of implicitly attaching to a channel and then publishing a message:

```[realtime_javascript]
const channel = realtime.channels.get('chatroom');
await channel.subscribe('action', (message) => { // implicit attach
  console.log('Message received ' + message.data);
});
await channel.publish('action', 'boom!');
```

```[realtime_nodejs]
const channel = realtime.channels.get('chatroom');
await channel.subscribe('action', (message) => { // implicit attach
  console.log('Message received ' + message.data);
});
await channel.publish('action', 'boom!');
```

```[realtime_ruby]
channel = realtime.channels.get('chatroom')
channel.subscribe('action') do |message| # implicit attach
  puts "Message received: #{message}";
end
channel.publish 'action', 'boom!'
```

```[realtime_python]
channel = realtime.channels.get('chatroom')
def listener(message):
  print('Message received: ' + message.data)
await channel.subscribe(listener)
await channel.publish('action', 'boom')
```

```[realtime_java]
Channel channel = realtime.channels.get("chatroom");
/* Implicit attach when subscribing */
channel.subscribe(new MessageListener() {
  @Override
  public void onMessage(Message message) {
    System.out.println("Message received: " + message.data);
  }
});
channel.publish("action", "boom!");
```

```[realtime_csharp]
IRealtimeChannel channel = realtime.Channels.Get("chatroom");
channel.Subscribe(message => Console.WriteLine("Message received: " + message.Data));
channel.Publish("action", "boom");
```

```[realtime_objc]
ARTRealtimeChannel *channel = [realtime.channels get:@"chatroom" options:options];
[channel subscribe:@"action" callback:^(ARTMessage *message) {
    NSLog(@"Message received: %@", message.data);
}]
[channel publish:@"action" data:@"boom!"];
```

```[realtime_swift]
let channel = realtime.channels.get("chatroom")
channel.subscribe("action") { message in
    print("Message received: \(message.data)")
}
channel.publish("action", data: "boom!")
```

```[realtime_flutter]
final channel = realtime.channels.get('chatroom');
/* Implicit attach when subscribing */
channel.subscribe(name: 'action').listen((ably.Message message) {
  print('Received: ${message.data}');
});
channel.publish(name: 'action', data: 'boom!');
```

```[realtime_go]
channel := realtime.Channels.Get("chatroom")
_, _ = channel.Subscribe(context.Background(), "action", func(msg *ably.Message) {
  fmt.Printf("Message received: '%v'\n", msg.Data)
})

_ = channel.Publish(context.Background(), "action", "boom!")
```

As subscribing to a channel implicitly attaches a client, it is important to understand that if a client subscribes to and then unsubscribes from a channel, the client remains attached. The client will continue to be sent published messages until they "@detach()@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/channels#detach from the channel.

<aside data-type='note'>
<p>Any errors in attaching to a channel are received via the "@attach()@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/channels#attach callback. When attaching implicitly you can listen for "channel state changes":/docs/channels/states#attach instead.</p>
</aside>

h3(#detach-unsubscribe). Detaching versus unsubscribing

It is also important to understand the difference between between detaching and unsubscribing from a channel, and that messages will continue to be sent to clients if they only call the "@unsubscribe()@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/channels#unsubscribe method

The "@detach()@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/channels#detach method detaches a client from a channel. A client will no longer receive any messages published to the channel once they detach. @unsubscribe()@ only removes message listeners for a channel and is a client-side operation. To reiterate, Ably is unaware of whether or not a client has subscribed or unsubscribed from a channel. Messages will continue to be streamed to the client until @detach()@ is called.

As "@subscribe()@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/channels#subscribe implicitly attaches a client to a channel, be aware that if you call @subscribe()@ followed by @unsubscribe()@, the client remains attached to the channel and will continue to be streamed messages from Ably.

h3(#server-subscribe). Server subscriptions

Subscribing to events server-side using the pub-sub pattern can be disadvantageous as it can increase latency, or duplicate events between multiple servers.

"Message queues":/docs/integrations/queues are more appropriate to use in this instance, as multiple worker servers enable Ably to distribute the load of messages received. This ensures that each message is only processed once, by any one of your worker servers.

h3(#subscription-filters). Subscription filters

Subscription filters enable you to subscribe to a channel and only receive messages that satisfy a filter expression.

Messages are streamed to clients as soon as they "attach":/docs/channel/states#attach to a channel, if they have the @subscribe@ "capability":/docs/auth/capabilities for it. Subscription filters apply server-side filtering to messages, meaning that a client will only ever receive the messages that they subscribe to.

Subscription filters are currently in preview status.

<aside data-type="note">
<p>Normal "limits":/docs/pricing/limits still apply when using subscription filters. As such, it is not recommended to publish all data to a single channel and rely solely on subscription filters. A level of partitioning at the channel level is still required for the majority of use cases.</p>
</aside>

h4(#filter-create). Create a filter expression

Filter expressions should be written using "JMESPath.":https://jmespath.org/ They can be constructed using the message name and @message.extras.headers@ fields.

@message.extras.headers@ optionally provides ancillary metadata to a message, as Ably can't inspect message payloads themselves. Adding suitable key-value pairs to messages will enable more complicated filter expressions to be constructed resulting in more effective message filtering.

The following is an example of publishing a message with additional metadata:

```[realtime_javascript]
const channel = realtime.channels.get('scoops-kiosk');
await channel.publish({
    name: 'ice-cream',
    data: '...',
    extras: {
        headers: {
            flavor: 'strawberry',
            cost: 35,
            temp: 3
        }
    }
});
```

```[realtime_java]
Channel channel = realtime.channels.get("scoops-kiosk");

final JsonObject json = new JsonObject();
json.addProperty("flavor", "strawberry");
json.addProperty("cost", 35);
json.addProperty("temp", 3);

MessageExtras extras = new MessageExtras(json);

Message message = new Message();
message.name = "ice-cream";
message.data = "...";
message.extras = extras;

channel.publish(new Message[]{message});
```

```[realtime_python]
channel = realtime.channels.get('scoops-kiosk')
extras = {
  'headers': {
    'flavor': 'strawberry',
    'cost': 35,
    'temp': 3
  }
}

message = Message(name='ice-cream', data='test', extras=extras)
await channel.publish(message)
```

```[realtime_go]
realtime, err := ably.NewRealtime(
  ably.WithKey("{{API_KEY}}"))
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

channel := realtime.Channels.Get("scoops-kiosk")

message := &ably.Message{
  Name: "ice-cream",
  Data: "...",
  Extras: map[string]interface{}{
    "headers": map[string]interface{}{
      "flavor": "strawberry",
      "cost":   35,
      "temp":   3,
    },
  },
}

err = channel.Publish(context.Background(), "event", message)
```

```[realtime_flutter]
final channel = realtime.channels.get('scoops-kiosk');
final messageData = ably.Message(
  name: 'ice-cream',
  data: '...',
  extras: const ably.MessageExtras({
    'headers': {
      'flavor': 'strawberry',
      'cost': 35,
      'temp': 3,
    },
  }),
);

await channel.publish(message: messageData);
```

```[rest_javascript]
const channel = rest.channels.get('scoops-kiosk');
await channel.publish({
    name: 'ice-cream',
    data: '...',
    extras: {
        headers: {
            flavor: "strawberry",
            cost: 35,
            temp: 3
        }
    }
});
```

```[rest_java]
Channel channel = rest.channels.get("scoops-kiosk");

final JsonObject json = new JsonObject();
json.addProperty("flavor", "strawberry");
json.addProperty("cost", 35);
json.addProperty("temp", 3);

MessageExtras extras = new MessageExtras(json);

Message message = new Message();
message.name = "ice-cream";
message.data = "...";
message.extras = extras;

channel.publish(new Message[]{message});
```

```[rest_python]
channel = rest.channels.get('scoops-kiosk')
extras = {
  'headers': {
    'flavor': 'strawberry',
    'cost': 35,
    'temp': 3
  }
}

message = Message(name='ice-cream', data='test', extras=extras)
await channel.publish(message)
```

```[rest_php]
$channel = $rest->channels->get('scoops-kiosk');
$extras = [
    'headers' => [
        'flavor' => 'strawberry',
        'cost' => 35,
        'temp' => 3
    ]
];

$message = new \Ably\Models\Message();
$message->name = 'ice-cream';
$message->data = 'test';
$message->extras = $extras;

$channel->publish($message);
```

```[rest_go]
rest, err := ably.NewREST(
  ably.WithKey("{{API_KEY}}"))
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

channel := rest.Channels.Get("scoops-kiosk")

message := &ably.Message{
  Name: "ice-cream",
  Data: "...",
  Extras: map[string]interface{}{
    "headers": map[string]interface{}{
      "flavor": "strawberry",
      "cost":   35,
      "temp":   3,
    },
  },
}

err = channel.Publish(context.Background(), "event", message)
```

```[rest_flutter]
final channel = rest.channels.get('scoops-kiosk');
final messageData = ably.Message(
  name: 'ice-cream',
  data: '...',
  extras: const ably.MessageExtras({
    'headers': {
      'flavor': 'strawberry',
      'cost': 35,
      'temp': 3,
    },
  }),
);

await channel.publish(message: messageData);
```

Be aware that @message.extras.headers@ must be a flat object. It can't contain any further nesting or arrays.

The following is an example of a filter expression subscribing to messages with the name “ice-cream”, a flavor of “strawberry” and a cost of less than 50:

```[text]
name == `"ice-cream"` && headers.flavor == `"strawberry"` && headers.cost < `50`
```

The following is an example of a filter expression subscribing to messages with a flavor of either “strawberry” or “chocolate”:

```[text]
headers.flavor == `"strawberry"` || headers.flavor == `"chocolate"`
```

h4(#filter-subscribe). Subscribe with a filter

In order to subscribe to a channel with a filter expression, you obtain a channel instance using the @getDerived()@ method. This accepts a filter expression as a parameter.

The following is an example of subscribing to a channel using one of the previous example filters:

```[realtime_javascript]
const channel = realtime.channels.getDerived('scoops-kiosk', {
  filter: 'name == `"ice-cream"` && headers.flavor == `"strawberry"` && headers.cost < `50`'
})
await channel.subscribe(...);
```

```[realtime_go]
filter := "name == `\"ice-cream\"` && headers.flavor == `\"strawberry\"` && headers.cost < `50`"
channel, _ := realtime.Channels.GetDerived("scoops-kiosk", ably.DeriveOptions{Filter: filter})

_, err = channel.Subscribe(context.Background(), "scoops-kiosk", func(msg *ably.Message) {
  fmt.Printf("Received message : '%v'\n", msg.Data)
})
```

<aside data-type="note">
<p>Clients that are publishing to the same channel that they are subscribed to using a filter need to obtain a channel instance twice. Once with the filter expression using @getDerived()@ for the subscription and once using "@get()@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/channels#get for publishing. Attempts to publish to a channel created or retrieved with a filter expression will fail.</p>
</aside>

The following example demonstrates publishing to a channel, but subscribing to only a subset of messages on it:

```[realtime_javascript]
// Connect to Ably
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({'{{API_KEY}}'});

// Create a channel instance to publish to
const pubChannel = realtime.channels.get('scoops-kiosk');

// Create a channel instance using the filter qualifier
const subChannel = realtime.channels.getDerived('scoops-kiosk', {
   filter: 'name == `"ice-cream"` && headers.flavor == `"strawberry"` && headers.cost < `50`'
});

// Subscribe to the channel using the filtered subscription
await subChannel.subscribe((message) => {
   alert('Ice cream update: ' + message.data);
 });

// Publish to the unfiltered channel instance
await pubChannel.publish({
   name: 'ice-cream',
   data: '...',
   extras: {
       headers: {
           flavor: 'strawberry',
           cost: 35,
           temp: 3
       }
   });
});
```

h4(#filter-capabilities). Subscription filter capabilities

Clients require the subscribe "capability":/docs/auth/capabilities for one of the following resources in order to receive messages from a subscription filter:

* @[filter]<channel name>@
* @[*]<channel name>@
* @[*]*@

A client may also "attach":/docs/channels/states#attach to the unfiltered instance of a channel for other operations, such as to subscribe to the "presence":/docs/presence-occupancy/presence set. Be aware that if clients attach to the unfiltered instance, and have the subscribe capability for the channel itself, they will be sent all messages by Ably. This is because of the "difference between attaching and subscribing":#attach-subscribe to a channel.

The following features are not supported using subscription filters:

* "Presence":/docs/presence-occupancy/pre
* "History":/docs/storage-history/history
* "Deltas":/docs/channels/options/deltas
* "Rewind ":/docs/channels/options/rewind

h2(#publish). Publish

There are several more advanced concepts involved in publishing messages once you've understood the "basics of publishing":/docs/pub-sub#publish messages.

As a reminder, to publish a message to a channel:

  channel.publish(name: 'example', data: 'message data');
```

```[rest_go]
rest, err := ably.NewREST(
  ably.WithKey("{{API_KEY}}"))
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
channel := rest.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
if err := channel.Publish(context.Background(), "example", "message data"); err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
```

h3(#multiple). Publish to multiple channels

To publish a single message to multiple channels, make multiple "@publish()@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/channels#publish requests using the realtime interface of an SDK. These concurrent requests can be in-flight simultaneously, ensuring that a publish on one channel does not delay operations in other channels.

To publish to multiple channels in a single call, use the "batch publish":/docs/messages/batch#batch-publish feature.

h3(#echo). Echoing messages

By default, clients will receive their own messages if they are also subscribed to the channel. This is known as echoing.

Set the "@echoMessages@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#client-options property of @ClientOptions@ to @false@ to disable this behavior. This will stop clients from receiving the messages that they published themselves, but they will continue to receive messages published by others.

This property is only available using the realtime interface of an SDK, as it isn't possible to subscribe to messages using the REST interface.

h3(#transient-publish). Transient publishing

Transient publishing is when a client publishes messages without attaching to a channel. This is a feature of the realtime interface of "certain Ably SDKs":/docs/sdks. Transient publishing can be beneficial if you intend to publish to many channels as it removes the need to attach to a channel each time you publish. It also avoids a client subscribing to messages which avoids messages being sent to it redundantly.

The following is an example of publishing without attaching to a channel:

```[realtime_javascript]
const channel = realtime.channels.get('chatroom');
// The publish below will not attach you to the channel
await channel.publish('action', 'boom!');
```

```[realtime_nodejs]
const channel = realtime.channels.get('chatroom');
// The publish below will not attach you to the channel
await channel.publish('action', 'boom!');
```

```[realtime_java]
Channel channel = ably.channels.get("chatroom");
// The publish below will not attach you to the channel
channel.publish("action", "boom!");
```

```[realtime_ruby]
channel = realtime.channels.get('chatroom')
# The publish below will not attach you to the channel
channel.publish 'action', 'boom!'
```

```[realtime_swift]
let channel = realtime.channels.get("chatroom")
// The publish below will not attach you to the channel
channel.publish("action", data: "boom!")
```

```[realtime_flutter]
final channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
// The publish below will not attach you to the channel
await channel.publish(name: 'example', data: 'message data');
```

```[realtime_go]
channel := realtime.Channels.Get("chatroom")
channel.Publish(context.Background(), "action", "boom!")
```

h3(#ephemeral). Ephemeral messages

A message can be marked as *ephemeral* to exempt it from:
- being stored in "persisted history":/docs/storage-history/storage
- being sent in "attachment rewinds":/docs/channels/options/rewind
- being sent to clients "resuming over a period of disconnection":/docs/connect/states
- being sent to "firehose, webhooks, and queue integrations":/docs/integrations

In other words, it will be exempt from everything except being delivered to currently-connected realtime connections.

This is useful for events that are relevant only at the time they are published, and have no value when stale; examples might be streaming of continuously changing values such as realtime telemetry, position information, etc. Since ephemeral messages can be interspersed with other non-ephemeral messages on a channel, it is possible to use a single channel to convey all relevant events for some entity, including a mix of some that need to be persisted and others that are only ephemeral.

To mark a message as ephemeral, either include @ephemeral: true@ in the message's extras object, or (for REST publishes) include @ephemeral: true@ in the publish params.

The following is an example of publishing an ephemeral message:

```[realtime_javascript]
const channel = realtime.channels.get('chatroom');
await channel.publish({name: 'emote', data: ':heart:', extras: { ephemeral: true }});
```

```[rest_javascript]
const channel = rest.channels.get('chatroom');
await channel.publish('emote', ':heart:', { ephemeral: true });
// or
await channel.publish({ name: 'emote', data: ':heart:' }, { ephemeral: true });
```

Note that if using the form of publish that takes an array of messages to be published atomically, either all the messages must be marked ephemeral or none of them. If they are mixed, the publish will be rejected.

h3(#idempotency). Idempotent publishing

Idempotency ensures that multiple publishes of the same message cannot result in duplicate messages.

It is possible that a client publishing a message using the REST interface may not receive acknowledgement of receipt from Ably, due to issues such as network failure outside of Ably's control. Clients will internally attempt to re-publish messages in these instances.

When idempotent publishing is enabled, the Ably SDK will internally assign a unique ID to each message which ensures that subsequent retry attempts cannot result in duplicate messages. Idempotent publishing is enabled by default in all latest Ably SDKs. It can be disabled by setting the @idempotentRestPublishing@ "@ClientOptions@":/docs/api/rest-sdk#client-options to @false@.

Note that Ably can only detect duplicate messages within a 2-minute window after the original message, with the same ID, is published. If a message with the same ID is published after this 2-minute window, it will be treated as a new message.

You can also specify message IDs externally. The following is an example of how you might do this:

```[rest_javascript]
const rest = new Ably.Rest('{{API_KEY}}');
const channel = rest.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
await channel.publish([{data: 'payload', id: 'unique123'}]);
```

```[rest_go]
rest, err := ably.NewREST(
  ably.WithKey("{{API_KEY}}"))
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Error creating Ably client: %v", err)
}

channel := rest.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")

message := &ably.Message{
  Data: "payload",
  ID:   "unique123",
}

// Publish the message to the channel
err = channel.Publish(context.Background(), "eventName", message)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Error publishing message: %v", err)
}
```

```[rest_java]
ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions("{{API_KEY}}");
AblyRealtime ably = new AblyRealtime(options);
Channel channel = ably.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");

Message message = new Message();
message.data = "payload";
message.id = "unique123";

channel.publish(new Message[]{message});
```

If manually specifying message IDs, it is important to be aware of how messages are published when calling the "publish()":/docs/api/rest-sdk/channels#publish method with an array of messages. See this "FAQ":https://faqs.ably.com/client-specified-message-id-restrictions-for-multiple-messages-published-atomically for further information.

h3(#publish-on-behalf). Publishing on behalf of a realtime connection

You can use the REST interface of an Ably SDK to publish messages on behalf of a realtime "connection":/docs/connect.

To publish on behalf of a realtime connection, the REST publisher requires the "@connectionKey@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/connection#key of the realtime client. The @connectionKey@ is a secret of the client unless explicitly shared. The REST publisher can then set the @connectionKey@ "in the root of the published message":/docs/api/rest-sdk/messages#connection-key.

If the realtime connection is "identified":/docs/auth/identified-clients by being bound to a @clientId@, then the REST publish must include that same @clientId@. This can be included in "the message itself":/docs/api/rest-sdk/messages#client-id to apply to only that message, in the case that the REST client is able to assume any @clientId@, or using a REST client bound to that specific @clientId@.

The publish attempt will fail in the following scenarios:

* the @connectionKey@ is invalid
* the @connectionKey@ belongs to a connection that has since been closed
* the REST publisher is using a different Ably application to the realtime client
* the @clientId@s don't match between the realtime connection and the REST publish
