"Ably Reactor Events":https://www.ably.io/reactor allow your servers to be notified or your server-less functions to be invoked via an HTTP request following "channel lifecycle events":/realtime/channel-metadata#lifecycle-events (such as channel creation), presence events (such as members entering or leaving) or messages being published.

In this tutorial we will show you how to:

* Set up a WebHook rule to publish messages from a channel to your web server
* Create a simple Ruby on Rails web server to serve up the web app, issue authentication tokens for the Realtime browser client and process incoming WebHook requests from Ably
* Publish questions from a Realtime browser client to a channel, which are automatically delivered to your server via the WebHook
* Communicate with the "Chuck Norris API":http://products.wolframalpha.com/short-answers-api/documentation/ to get the answer, and publish the answer as a message back to the client using the REST API
* Subscribe to jokes published from Rails in the web app using a realtime pub/sub channel

The following diagram depicts the architecture for this tutorial:

h2. Step 2 - Install Rails

This tutorial is not intended to teach you how to develop using Rails and expect that you have some basic knowledge of Rails beforehand. If you are new to Rails, please the "Getting Started with Rails guide":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html.

To install Rails, make sure you have Ruby and RubGems installed, and run the following command to install the Rails gem:

```[sh]
  gem install rails
```

To create a new Rails application for this tutorial, use the Rails generators to create a ready-to-use vanilla Rails application:

```[sh]
  rails new webhook-demo --skip-active-record
  cd webhook-demo
```

Please note that we included @--skip-active-record@ so as to avoid an unnecessary dependency on a database for this tutorial. In most Rails applications, @ActiveRecord@ is in fact needed so there would be no need to skip its installation.

Lets make sure Rails has been installed correctly by running @bin/rails server@ and opening a browser window to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/. You should see the Rails default information page.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/webhook-ruby-step2

h2. Step 3 - Set up a root route and add base HTML app

The Rails deafult information page is currently being served because there are no routes yet configured.  Let's add a route to "@config/routes.rb@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/a44352a21cf532febdc653bb83270935871acdbd/config/routes.rb by adding the following:

```[ruby]
  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    root to: 'home#index'
  end
```

The route is referencing the action @index@ for the as yet undefined @HomeController@ so let's add that at "app/controllers/home_controller.rb":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/a44352a21cf532febdc653bb83270935871acdbd/app/controllers/home_controller.rb:

```[ruby]
  class HomeController < ApplicationController
    def index
    end
  end
```

We are still missing a view for the @index@ action, so let's add a base view for the app at "app/views/home/index.html.erb":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/a44352a21cf532febdc653bb83270935871acdbd/app/views/home/index.html.erb:

```[html]
  <h1>Chuck Norris Jokes</h1>

  <div class="col">
    <h2>Search for joke</h2>
    <input type="text" id="text" placeholder="Enter text to find a joke or leave empty"></input>
    <button id="action-btn">Make me laugh Chuck!</button><span id="status"></span>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h2>Chuck Norris Jokes</h2>
    <div id="output"></div>
  </div>
```

And finally let's add some Javascript as a placeholder for our app at "app/assets/javascripts/application.js":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/720aa38537d842b54234320304758a077a5d6be1/app/assets/javascripts/application.js:

```[javascript]
  $(function() {
    var $actionButton = $('#action-btn');
    $actionButton.on('click', function() {
      alert("Not yet implemented");
    });
  });
```

Open a browser window to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ and confirm that you can see the new Chuck Norris base app page.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/webhook-ruby-step3

h2. Step 4 - Install Ably for Rails (server-side) and add auth route

To start using Ably within your Rails server, you first need to install the Ably gem. Generally with Rails applications, as they are synchronous, the REST library is preferred over the Realtime library. The Realtime library must be run within an "EventMachine reactor":https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine which provides an asynchronous evented framework. For this tutorial, the REST only version of the Ably Rubygem is used as it requires less dependencies and is a perfect fit for this synchronous Rails application.

Add the following to your "@Gemfile@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/2197a076f89a0103f85df9393c46192964c5772b/Gemfile

```[ruby]
  gem 'ably-rest', '~>1.0'
```

Then run the following command to install the required gems:

```[sh]
  bundle install
```

Before we add the REST library to the Rails application, we need to add the private API key you copied in Step 1 to the Rails "@config/secrets.yml@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/2197a076f89a0103f85df9393c46192964c5772b/config/secrets.yml. Add the following to the @development@ and @production@ sections of your @config/secrets.yml@ file:

```[yaml]
development:
  ably_api_key: [INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE]

production:
  ably_api_key: [INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE]
```

Please note that whilst we have simplified the process for the purposes of this tutorial, we would recommend that you consider the "twelve-factor methodology":https://12factor.net/ when configuring secrets - instead of adding the secrets to the configuration file, use environment variables by referencing them i.e. @ably_api_key: <@@%= ENV['ABLY_API_KEY'] %>@.

Let's now add the stateless Ruby REST library as an instance variable on the @ApplicationController@ so that it's available to all controllers. Add the following to "@app/controllers/application_controller.rb@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/2197a076f89a0103f85df9393c46192964c5772b/app/controllers/application_controller.rb

```[ruby]
  def ably_rest
    @ably_rest ||= Ably::Rest.new(key: Rails.application.secrets.ably_api_key)
  end
```

Now we want to issue token requests for Realtime clients that want to authenticate with Ably. The Rails application has an API key that it can use to sign these token requests, and the Rails application can serve up these token requests through a new route. Add the following route to "@config/routes.rb@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/2197a076f89a0103f85df9393c46192964c5772b/config/routes.rb:

```[ruby]
  get '/auth' => 'auth#issue_token_request'
```

That route is referencing the @issue_token_request@ action of the as yet undefined @AuthController@, so let's create "@app/controllers/auth_controller.rb@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/2197a076f89a0103f85df9393c46192964c5772b/app/controllers/auth_controller.rb now:

```[ruby]
class AuthController < ApplicationController
  def issue_token_request
    render json: ably_rest.auth.create_token_request
  end
end
```

Try visiting "http://localhost:3000/auth":http://localhost:3000/auth and you should see a JSON token request in the form:

```[json]
{
  "keyName": "I2ACJQ.Lv8AUQ",
  "ttl": 3600000,
  "timestamp": 1473894038255,
  "capability": "{\"*\":[\"*\"]}",
  "nonce": "f6799a8e7fa6f77b8e1dac55314789b1",
  "mac": "35nifY9SRZ8KRDfKOPIS1qYWGP16r2lD59zJo9TH8pA="
}
```

We now have a web server running with an authentication endpoint. We are ready to setup the Ably Realtime client that uses token auth.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/webhook-ruby-step4

h2. Step 5 - Plug in Ably client-side and update UI

As we've just set up the auth endpont to support the "token authentication scheme":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication, we will proceed to set up a Realtime client library that will request a token immediately from the web server auth endpoint before authenticating with Ably.

First we need to ensure the Ably client library is loaded from our CDN. Add this script tag to "@app/views/layouts/application.html.erb@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/4b3548a3afbd48c46a62ce212a7b844a7c2be159/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:

```[html]
  <head>
    <!-- other head content -->
    <script src="//cdn.ably.io/lib/ably.min-1.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  </head>
```

Then add the following to your application code at "@app/assets/javascripts/application.js@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/4b3548a3afbd48c46a62ce212a7b844a7c2be159/app/assets/javascripts/application.js:

```[javascript]
  var ably = new Ably.Realtime({ authUrl: '/auth' });
  ably.connection.on('connecting', function() { showStatus('Connecting to Ably...'); });
  ably.connection.on('connected', function() { clearStatus(); });
  ably.connection.on('disconnected', function() { showStatus('Disconnected from Ably...'); });
  ably.connection.on('suspended', function() { showStatus('Disconnected from Ably for a while...'); });

  var $status = $('#status');
  function showStatus(text) {
    $status.text(text).show();
  }
  function clearStatus() {
    $status.hide();
  }
```

The Ably Realtime client will now automatically obtain a token request from the provided @authUrl@ and then connect to Ably using that token request for authentication. At this point, visit "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ and you should see the status element change to "Connecting to Ably..." whilst a connection is established, and the status become empty once the connection is established.

Now let's hook up the publishing of the Chuck Norris search text to an Ably channel within "@application.js@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/4b3548a3afbd48c46a62ce212a7b844a7c2be159/app/assets/javascripts/application.js:

```[javascript]
  var publishChannel = ably.channels.get('chuck:ask');
  var $actionButton = $('#action-btn');
  var $text = $('#text');

  $actionButton.on('click', () => {
    /* Publish search text to the Ably channel so that a WebHook is triggered */
    publishChannel.publish('text', $text.val(), function(err) {
      if (err) {
        return showStatus('Failed to publish to Chuck!');
      }
    });
    $text.val(''); /* clear search for next query */
  });
```

And add a subscriber that listens for new Chuck Norris jokes within "@application.js@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/4b3548a3afbd48c46a62ce212a7b844a7c2be159/app/assets/javascripts/application.js:

```[javascript]
  var jokeChannel = ably.channels.get('chuck:jokes');
  var $output = $('#output');

  jokeChannel.subscribe(function(message) {
    var $joke = $('<div class="joke">').text(message.data.joke);
    $output.prepend($('<div>').append($joke));
  });
```

At this point the web app will instance an Ably Realtime library and connect to Ably, will publish messages to the @chuck:ask@ channel when requested, and will automatically subscribe to answers from the @chuck:jokes@ channel. However the WebHook is not in place yet, so at this point publishing a request for a joke won't do anything.

Finally, add "this styling CSS":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/4b3548a3afbd48c46a62ce212a7b844a7c2be159/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css to "@app/assets/stylesheets/application.css":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/4b3548a3afbd48c46a62ce212a7b844a7c2be159/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css so that the app's aesthetic is addressed.

"See this complete step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/webhook-ruby-step5

h2. Step 6 - Add WebHook endpoint and configure WebHook

Before we configure a WebHook, the Rails application needs to respond to WebHook requests. Let's set up a route, and then add the controller after.  Add this to "@config/routes.rb@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/fcab8df5749aadeb8de8a98d284eecf941e742da/config/routes.rb:

```[ruby]
  post '/webhook/chuck' => 'webhook#chuck_request', format: :json
```

Notice that all WebHook requests are delivered using the @POST@ HTTP verb, and based on the encoding we choose when configuring the WebHook, will be delivered with a JSON mimetype encoding.

Let's create the WebHook controller and action in "@app/controllers/webhook_controller.rb@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/fcab8df5749aadeb8de8a98d284eecf941e742da/app/controllers/webhook_controller.rb:

```[ruby]
class WebhookController < ApplicationController
  # Incoming WebHooks don't come from this web application so will not have an
  # authentication token from this web application
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def chuck_request
    webhook_envelope = JSON.parse(request.body.read)

    # WebHook messages are sent in items.data.messages, see https://goo.gl/WT9DnH
    if webhook_envelope["items"] && webhook_envelope["items"].kind_of?(Array)
      webhook_envelope["items"].each do |item|
        Array(item.dig('data', 'messages')).each do |message_raw|
          # Use Ably to decode messages from JSON so all decoding issues are handled by Ably
          message = Ably::Models::Message.from_json(message_raw)
          puts "Received Message with data '#{message.data}'"
        end
      end
      # Must respond with 20x response else the WebHook request will be retried
      render json: { "success": true }
    else
      render json: { "error": "items Array attribute missing from body" },
             status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
end
```

Now that the Rails application is ready to receive WebHook requests, you can set up a WebHook rule. However, in most cases, when running a Rails application locally (like we are doing now for this tutorial), the Rails app will not have a publicly addressable hostname and port. As such, you either have to deploy your Rails app to a web server, or alternatively you can use a tunneling service to your localhost like "Ngrok":https://ngrok.com/. We have used "Ngrok":https://ngrok.com/ extensively and would highly recommend you consider it. For this tutorial, we assume you have "installed ngrok":https://ngrok.com/download.

Run ngrok to obtain a public endpoint for your local Rails server as follows:

```[sh]
  ngrok http 3000
  ngrok by @inconshreveable
  Tunnel Status                 online
  Update                        update available (version 2.0.24, Ctrl-U to update)
  Version                       2.0.19/2.1.18
  Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
  Forwarding                    http://f1a38682.ngrok.io -> localhost:3000
  Forwarding                    https://f1a38682.ngrok.io -> localhost:3000
```

Keep the ngrok process running, and visit the secure (https) Forwarding address provided to you in your browser. In this case it's @https://f1a38682.ngrok.io@. Confirm that you can see the Chuck Norris home page which in turn means you have a public endpoint for the WebHook you are about to set up.

To set up a WebHook for this endpoint, follow these steps:

# "Log into your app dashboard":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030053-how-do-i-access-my-app-dashboard
# Create a new app by selecting "Create New App", or select an existing one that you wish to use
# Click the "Reactor" tab
# Click on "New Reactor Rule"
# Click "Choose" under "Reactor Event"
# Click "Choose" under "WebHooks". When prompted, enter the name Ngrok endpoint + the Webhook route configured previously such as @https://f1a38682.ngrok.io/webhook/chuck@, choose @Message@ as your source, and ensure that the channel filter @^chuck:ask@ is included to ensure only chuck joke requests are forwarded to your web server. See screenshot example below:

<a href="/images/tutorials/webhook-chuck-norris/webhook-chuck-setup.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/webhook-chuck-norris/webhook-chuck-setup.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Setting up a WebHook">
</a>

Once the WebHook is saved, you are now ready to test that WebHook is working. Visit "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ in your browser, enter some text in the text field, and click the "Make me laugh Chuck!" button. You should within a second see your Rails server report an incoming request in the console log along with the message "Received Message with data '...'". If you are having problems with the Webhook setup, please see "our recommendations for debugging WebHooks":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000062287-how-can-i-debug-webhooks.

"See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/webhook-ruby-step6

h2. Step 7 - Integrate with Chuck API and publish jokes over REST

Now that the publishing, subscribing, authentication and WebHooks are in place, it's time to hook the WebHook controller into the awesome Chuck Norris API. Modify "@app/controllers/webhook_controller.rb@":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/blob/7e00403f27e50be7b312bfa15b9d444c49ba48ee/app/controllers/webhook_controller.rb by adding logic to communicate with the API:

```[ruby]
  def get_random_joke
    response = JSON.parse(HTTP.get('https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random').to_s)
    publish_joke response['value']
  end

  def find_matching_jokes(text)
    url = "https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/search?query=#{CGI::escape(text)}"
    response = JSON.parse(HTTP.get(url).to_s)
    if response['result']
      response['result'].first(3).each do |joke|
        publish_joke joke['value']
      end
    else
      publish_joke "No Chuck joke matching text '#{text}'"
    end
  end

  def publish_joke(joke)
    ably_rest.channels.get('chuck:jokes').publish('joke', { joke: joke })
  end
```

Then replace the message processing in the same controller with:

```[ruby]
  Array(item.dig('data', 'messages')).each do |message_raw|
    message = Ably::Models::Message.from_json(message_raw)
    if message.data.strip.empty?
      get_random_joke
    else
      find_matching_jokes message.data
    end
  end
```

Once again, visit "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Either type a word or phrase to filter jokes on or go for a random joke and click "Make me laugh Chuck!" button. You should see a response from the Chuck Norris API appear within the time it takes for that API to provide a joke. Given it's a Chuck Norris API, that should be quick right?
