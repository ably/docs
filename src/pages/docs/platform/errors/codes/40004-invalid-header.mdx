# Error 40004: Invalid header

## What Happened

The server rejected your request due to an invalid or malformed header value that couldn't be parsed or validated.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40004 | 400 | Client Error (Validation) | No - requires fixing the header format |

## Quick Fix

- Check your HTTP headers for proper formatting and encoding
- Verify token TTL is within acceptable limits (â‰¤1 hour)
- Ensure all required header attributes are present

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "invalid header"
- "Invalid Link header"
- "Invalid Link header; missing rel"
- "Invalid Link header; missing params"
- "Invalid encoding"
- "Invalid encoding; missing format"
- "Invalid encoding; missing params"
- "Excessive value for ttl"

## Common Causes

1. **Invalid HTTP headers** (40% of cases)
   - Malformed Content-Type headers that can't be parsed
   - Link headers missing required attributes
   - Non-UTF8 encoded header values
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40004-analysis.md lines 76-82 -->

2. **Token TTL exceeds limits** (30% of cases)
   - JWT tokens with TTL greater than 1 hour
   - Platform validation incorrectly applied to embedded tokens
   - Token expiry calculation issues
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from support tickets https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40004-knowledge.md lines 34-63 -->

3. **Message encoding issues** (20% of cases)
   - Invalid or missing encoding format specification
   - Missing cipher parameters in encrypted messages
   - Malformed encoding strings
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40004-analysis.md lines 55-73 -->

4. **Auth callback issues** (10% of cases)
   - Auth callback responses with invalid Content-Type headers
   - Token authentication response header parsing failures
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40004-analysis.md lines 16-27 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **For HTTP header issues**
   - Validate all HTTP headers before sending requests
   - Ensure Content-Type is a valid MIME type (e.g., "application/json", "text/plain")
   - For Link headers, include both 'rel' and 'params' attributes
   - Use proper UTF-8 encoding for all header values
   <!-- Source: Resolution patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40004-knowledge.md lines 103-108 -->

2. **For token TTL issues**
   - Ensure JWT token TTL is 1 hour or less
   - Check token expiry time calculation (expiryTime - issuedTime)
   - If using JWTs embedding Ably tokens, verify the surrounding JWT's TTL
   - Review [Ably's token authentication documentation](https://ably.com/docs/auth/token)
   <!-- Source: Support incident resolution from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40004-knowledge.md lines 109-113 -->

3. **For message encoding issues**
   - Include format specification in encoding strings
   - Provide all required cipher parameters for encrypted messages
   - Follow the expected encoding string pattern
   - See [Ably's message encoding documentation](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/messages#message-encoding)
   <!-- Source: Resolution patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40004-knowledge.md lines 114-118 -->

4. **For auth callback issues**
   - Return valid Content-Type headers from auth callbacks
   - Ensure headers are parseable MIME types
   - Review your auth callback implementation
   - Reference [Ably's auth callback documentation](https://ably.com/docs/auth/token#auth-callback)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40004-analysis.md lines 16-27 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried. You must fix the header format or value before the request will succeed.

## Prevention

- Validate all headers before sending requests
- Use standard HTTP header formatting
- Keep JWT token TTL within 1 hour limit
- Test auth callbacks to ensure proper header formatting
- Follow Ably's encoding specifications for messages
