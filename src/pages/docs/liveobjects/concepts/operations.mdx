LiveObjects is currently Experimental. Its features are still in development and subject to rapid change.

LiveObjects operations define how object data is updated and synchronized across multiple clients.

When you create or update an object, the change is expressed as an _operation_ that is sent as an [object message](/docs/metadata-stats/stats#messages) on the channel. The operation is then applied to the object instance on all clients that are subscribed to the channel.

This document explains the key concepts you need to know when working with operations.

## Operation Types <a id="operation-types"/>

Each object type supports specific operations that modify the object's data.

### LiveMap Operations <a id="livemap"/>

[LiveMap](/docs/liveobjects/map) supports the following operations:

* `set`: Set a value for a key
* `remove`: Remove a key and its value

The value of an entry in a `LiveMap` instance can be a [primitive type](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#primitive-types) or a [reference](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#composability) to another object.

<Code>
```javascript
// Set a value for a key
await map.set('username', 'alice');

// Remove a key
await map.remove('username');
```

```swift
// Set a value for a key
try await map.set(key: "username", value: "alice")

// Remove a key
try await map.remove(key: "username")
```
</Code>

### LiveCounter Operations <a id="livecounter"/>

[LiveCounter](/docs/liveobjects/counter) supports the following operations:

* `increment`: Increment the counter by a specified amount
* `decrement`: Decrement the counter by a specified amount

The amount is a double-precision floating-point number, which is the same as underlying type of a [LiveCounter](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#livecounter) value.

<Aside data-type='note'>
The `decrement` operation is just syntactic sugar for `increment` with a negative amount.
</Aside>

<Code>
```javascript
// Increment counter by 5
await counter.increment(5);

// Decrement counter by 2
await counter.decrement(2);
```

```swift
// Increment counter by 5
try await counter.increment(amount: 5)

// Decrement counter by 2
try await counter.decrement(amount: 2)
```
</Code>

### Create Operations <a id="create-operations"/>

Create operations are used to instantiate new objects of a given type.

A create operation can optionally specify an initial value for the object.

<Code>
```javascript
// Create a map with initial values
const userMap = await channel.objects.createMap({
  username: 'alice',
  status: 'online'
});

// Create a counter with initial value
const scoreCounter = await channel.objects.createCounter(100);
```

```swift
// Create a map with initial values
let userMap = try await channel.objects.createMap(entries: [
    "username": "alice",
    "status": "online",
])

// Create a counter with initial value
let scoreCounter = try await channel.objects.createCounter(count: 100)
```
</Code>

When a create operation is processed, an [object ID](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#object-ids) for the new object instance is automatically generated for the object.

<Aside data-type='important'>
Newly created objects are not automatically [reachable](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#reachability) from the root object. You must explicitly add them to the object tree to prevent garbage collection.
</Aside>

## Object IDs <a id="object-ids"/>

Every operation is expressed relative to a specific object instance, identified by its [object ID](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#object-ids), which determines which object the operation is applied to.

When using a client library object IDs are handled automatically, allowing you work directly with object references:

<Code>
```javascript
// The published operation targets the object ID of the `userMap` object instance
await userMap.set('username', 'alice');
```

```swift
// The published operation targets the object ID of the `userMap` object instance
try await userMap.set(key: "username", "alice")
```
</Code>

Therefore it is important that you obtain an up-to-date object instance before performing operations on an object. For example, you can [subscribe](/docs/liveobjects/map#subscribe-data) to a `LiveMap` instance to ensure you always have an up-to-date reference to any child objects in the map:

<Code>
```javascript
const root = await channel.objects.getRoot();

let myCounter = root.get('myCounter');
root.subscribe(() => { myCounter = root.get('myCounter'); });

// before incrementing, ensure we have an up-to-date object reference if
// the counter instance at the 'myCounter' key in the root map changes
await myCounter.increment(1);
```

{ /* We can't map the JS example directly because Swift concurrency prevents us from mutating local variables in the way that the JS example does, so I tried to show how we might need to handle this scenario in a real-world app where things are isolated to the main actor. But it's long and ugly. */ }
```swift
struct MyView: View {
    var root: any LiveMap
    @State private var myCounter: (any LiveCounter)?

    var body: some View {
        Button("Increment the counter") {
            Task {
                try await myCounter?.increment(amount: 1)
            }
        }.onAppear {
            do {
                myCounter = try root.get(key: "myCounter")?.liveCounterValue

                // We keep a reference to the latest value that the root map
                // stores at the "myCounter" key, to ensure that upon tapping
                // the button, we increment the correct counter.

                try root.subscribe { _, _ in
                    MainActor.assumeIsolated {
                        do {
                            myCounter = try root.get(key: "myCounter")?.liveCounterValue
                        } catch {
                            // Error handling of root.get(key:) omitted for brevity
                        }
                    }
                }
            } catch {
                // Error handling of root.get(key:) omitted for brevity
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</Code>

In the [REST API](/docs/liveobjects/rest-api-usage#updating-objects-by-id), this relationship is made explicit:

<Code>
```shell
curl -X POST https://rest.ably.io/channels/my-channel/objects \
 -u "{{API_KEY}}"
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data \
'{
  "operation": "MAP_SET",
  "objectId": "root",
  "data": {"key": "username", "value": {"string": "alice"}}
}'
```
</Code>

## Batch Operations <a id="batch-operations"/>

[Batch operations](/docs/liveobjects/batch) can be used to batch a set of operations together:

* Multiple operations are grouped into a single atomic unit
* All operations in the batch either succeed together or fail together
* Operations in a batch are sent as a single message
* No operations from other clients can be interleaved within a batch
