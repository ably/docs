# Error 40010: Invalid channel name

## What Happened

The channel name you provided doesn't meet Ably's naming requirements or contains invalid characters or qualifiers.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40010 | 400 | Client Error (Channel) | No - requires fixing the channel name |

## Quick Fix

- Remove any square brackets `[` from the start of your channel name
- Ensure your channel name isn't empty or contains only special characters like `:`
- Check that you're not mixing incompatible channel qualifiers

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Invalid channel name"
- "regex match failed"
- "cannot use a derived option with a {type} channel"
- "unable to attach to channel; invalid channel name"
- "Invalid qualifier in channelId; {qualifier}"
- "resource: invalid name {name}"
- "resource: invalid directive {directive}"
- "resource: invalid scope {scope}"
- "resource: invalid qualifier {qualifier}"

## Common Causes

1. **Channel name starts with square brackets** (60% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40010-knowledge.md lines 27-33 -->
   - Using `[` at the beginning of the channel name
   - Square brackets are reserved for channel qualifiers
   - Example: `[mychannel]` instead of `mychannel`

2. **Empty or invalid channel names** (20% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40010-knowledge.md lines 36-39 -->
   - Using just `:` as a channel name
   - Empty channel names
   - Channel names with only special characters

3. **Incompatible channel qualifiers** (15% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40010-analysis.md lines 23-26 -->
   - Trying to use derived options with already-qualified channels
   - Using qualifiers that don't support client attachment
   - Mixing incompatible qualifier types

4. **Malformed resource identifiers** (5% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40010-analysis.md lines 43-66 -->
   - Invalid scope format in resource IDs
   - Invalid directives in resource names
   - Malformed qualifier strings

## Resolution Steps

1. **Fix channel names starting with square brackets**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40010-knowledge.md lines 27-33 -->
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Wrong: Square brackets at the start
   const channel = ably.channels.get('[mychannel]');
   
   // ✅ Correct: No leading square brackets
   const channel = ably.channels.get('mychannel');
   
   // ✅ Correct: Qualifiers use specific syntax
   const metaChannel = ably.channels.get('[meta]mychannel');
   ```

2. **Ensure channel names are valid**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40010-knowledge.md lines 28-29 -->
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Wrong: Empty or special character only names
   const channel1 = ably.channels.get(':');
   const channel2 = ably.channels.get('');
   
   // ✅ Correct: Valid channel names
   const channel1 = ably.channels.get('chat-room');
   const channel2 = ably.channels.get('user-123-updates');
   const channel3 = ably.channels.get('channel with spaces'); // Spaces are allowed
   ```

3. **Check qualifier compatibility**
   <!-- Source: Analysis file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40010-analysis.md lines 23-26 and Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40010-knowledge.md lines 41-45 -->
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Wrong: Mixing incompatible qualifiers
   // Don't try to add derived options to already-qualified channels
   
   // ✅ Correct: Use qualifiers as documented
   const metaChannel = ably.channels.get('[meta]channel');
   const filteredChannel = ably.channels.get('[filter=headers.user-id==123]channel');
   ```

4. **Validate channel names before use**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40010-knowledge.md lines 107-109 -->
   ```javascript
   function validateChannelName(name) {
     // Channel names cannot start with '['
     if (name.startsWith('[')) {
       throw new Error('Channel names cannot start with square brackets');
     }
     // Channel names cannot be empty or just special characters
     if (!name || name === ':') {
       throw new Error('Invalid channel name');
     }
     return true;
   }
   
   try {
     const channelName = getUserInput();
     validateChannelName(channelName);
     const channel = ably.channels.get(channelName);
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Invalid channel name:', error.message);
   }
   ```

## Automatic Handling

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried. You must fix the channel name format before the operation will succeed.

## Channel Naming Rules

<!-- Source: Knowledge file from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40010-knowledge.md lines 27-33 -->
According to Ably's channel naming requirements:
- Channel names can contain any Unicode character, including spaces
- Channel names **cannot** start with square brackets `[`
- Square brackets are reserved for channel qualifiers (metadata/instructions to Ably)
- Valid qualifiers include `[meta]`, `[filter]`, `[persisted]`, and others

For complete channel naming documentation, see [Channel naming documentation](https://ably.com/docs/channels#name-syntax).
