Knowing the time accurately is needed to create valid signed Ably "TokenRequests":/rest/authentication#token-authentication, so this option is useful for library instances on auth servers where for some reason the server clock cannot be kept synchronized through normal means, such as an "NTP daemon":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntpd . The server is queried for the current time once per client library instance (which stores the offset from the local clock), so if using this option you should avoid instancing a new version of the library for each request.<br>__Type: @Boolean@__
