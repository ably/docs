# Error 40144: Invalid JWT token format

## What Happened

Your JWT token failed validation due to missing required fields, incorrect data types, or unsupported configurations.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40144 | 400/401 | Client Error (Authentication) | No - requires fixing token format |

## Quick Fix

- Ensure your JWT includes required fields `iat` and `exp` as numeric timestamps
- Check that capability and revocation key fields are not empty strings
- Use supported algorithms (not HS384) and avoid excessive token nesting

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Invalid token; iat must be specified"
- "Invalid token; iat must be a number"
- "Invalid token; exp must be specified"
- "Invalid token; exp must be a number"
- "Invalid token request body; capability must not be the empty string"
- "Invalid capability"
- "Invalid token; revocationKey must not be the empty string"
- "Invalid token; revocationKey must be a string"
- "Invalid token; embedded JWT tokens cannot be nested more than once"
- "Invalid embedded access token"
- "HS384 is not supported"
- "Unexpected error decoding Ably token or JWT the token is not valid"

## Common Causes

1. **Missing or invalid timestamps** (60% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-analysis.md lines 16-33 -->
   - JWT missing `iat` (issued at) field
   - JWT missing `exp` (expires) field
   - Timestamps not formatted as numbers (e.g., strings or decimals with microseconds)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-knowledge.md lines 119-124 -->

2. **Library-generated format issues** (25% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-knowledge.md lines 118-125 -->
   - PHP Lcobucci/JWT library creating timestamps with microseconds
   - JWT libraries producing string timestamps instead of numbers
   - Demo token generators with incorrect field types
   - Python SDK authorization header conflicts with TokenRequest

3. **Invalid capability or configuration** (10% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-analysis.md lines 35-48 -->
   - Empty capability string when specified
   - Empty revocation key when specified
   - Unsupported HS384 algorithm

4. **Token nesting issues** (5% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-analysis.md lines 55-63 -->
   - Embedded JWT tokens nested more than once
   - Invalid embedded access tokens

## Resolution Steps

1. **Validate your JWT structure**
   - Decode your token using [JWT.io](https://jwt.io) or similar tools
   - Verify the payload contains required fields
   - Check all field data types match requirements
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-knowledge.md lines 89-93 -->

2. **Ensure required fields are correct**
   Your JWT payload must include:
   - `iat`: Unix timestamp as a whole number (e.g., `1234567890`)
   - `exp`: Unix timestamp as a whole number (e.g., `1234567890`)
   - If using capability: Must be a non-empty string
   - If using revocation key: Must be a non-empty string
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-analysis.md lines 16-48 -->

3. **Fix library-specific issues**
   
   **For PHP Lcobucci/JWT users:**
   Configure the library to use integer timestamps only. By default, it creates timestamps with microseconds which Ably rejects. See the [library discussion](https://github.com/lcobucci/jwt/discussions/623) for configuration details.
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-knowledge.md lines 118-125, 167-172 -->
   
   **For Kafka Connect/Confluent integration:**
   Add these converter configurations:
   - `key.converter: org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter`
   - `value.converter: org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter`
   - `value.converter.schemas.enable: false`
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-knowledge.md lines 126-134 -->
   
   **For Python SDK with auth_url and headers:**
   If encountering issues with TokenRequest and authorization headers:
   - Option 1: Return a JWT or Ably token instead of TokenRequest
   - Option 2: Use auth_callback instead of auth_url
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-knowledge.md lines 142-151 -->

4. **Test with a minimal valid token**
   Create a simple token with only required fields to isolate the issue.
   See the [Ably JWT authentication documentation](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#ably-jwt) for token structure requirements.
   <!-- Source: Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication -->

5. **Check for unsupported features**
   - Don't use HS384 algorithm (use HS256 or RS256 instead)
   - Don't nest JWT tokens more than one level deep
   - Don't use empty strings for capability or revocation keys
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40144-analysis.md lines 65-68, 35-48 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried. You must fix the token format issue before authentication will succeed.

## Prevention

- Use established JWT libraries with proper configuration for integer timestamps
- Validate tokens after generation using JWT debugging tools
- Test your token generation with the specific Ably SDK you're using
- Monitor authentication failures during development to catch format issues early
- Be aware of SDK-specific behaviors (Python vs JavaScript differences)

## Related Errors

• **[40140 - Token Expired](https://help.ably.io/error/40140)**  
  Token has passed its expiration time - differs from 40144 which indicates exp field format issues

• **[40141 - Token Unrecognized](https://help.ably.io/error/40141)**  
  Token cannot be parsed at all, while 40144 indicates specific validation failures

• **[40142 - Token Revoked](https://help.ably.io/error/40142)**  
  Valid format token that has been revoked, unlike 40144's format issues

• **[40103 - Invalid Use of Basic Auth](https://help.ably.io/error/40103)**  
  Authentication method issues that may lead to JWT validation attempts

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Clear documentation on Python SDK auth_url behavior with headers vs JavaScript SDK
- Impact: Developers experience inconsistent behavior across SDKs leading to authentication failures
- Recommendation: Document SDK-specific authentication patterns and differences prominently
- Severity: Medium - causes confusion but workarounds exist
