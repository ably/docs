The user that creates an Ably account is assigned the account owner role. An account owner has permission to undertake any action within an account, such as inviting new users. There are two other account roles that inherit a subset of an account owner's permissions. An account can only have a single account owner.

## User roles <a id="roles"/>

Users can be assigned to the following roles. Each user may be assigned multiple roles:

* Developer
* Billing
* Admin
* Owner

User roles have the following permissions:
