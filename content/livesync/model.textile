A @model@ is a single instance of live, observable data connected to a database. This architecture allows for independent frontend data representation from database structure, creating a decoupled approach to data management.

A Model represents a unique, real-time data model directly linked to your database. This allows you to display your data model in your frontend application in any desired format, independent of your database's data representation.

When creating a Model, it is important to provide a unique name that can easily identify it within your application. You also need to specify the name of an "@Ably channel@":/channels that will be used to broadcast updates to the model's state from the backend. If there is no existing model with the provided name, a new one will be created. However, if there is an existing model with the same name, you will receive the instance of the existing model.

```
type Post = {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  comments: string[];
};
```

You need to register the model to your application code, which is described in @sync function@.
