      Pub/Sub is Ably’s cloud-based, publish/subscribe, platform-as-a-service (PaaS) product. It provides a set of consistent and idiomatic APIs across a variety of platforms for building realtime capabilities in applications including live data broadcast, push notifications, stream processing, and chat. With Pub/Sub, developers can build applications that communicate in realtime without needing to manage things such as scaling, latency, data integrity and network outages.
