title: Publish & Subscribe Tutorial
section: tutorials
index: 10
---

The Ably Realtime service organises the message traffic within applications into named channels. Channels are the “unit” of message distribution; clients attach to any number of channels to subscribe to messages, and every message published to a channel is broadcasted to all subscribers. This scalable and resilient messaging pattern is commonly called pub/sub.

As you can publish a message to any channel, channels provide a means for you to filter data by topic or enforce access control for your subscribers. Only subscribers for those channesl will receive those messages.

Messages published can contain string, JSON object, JSON array or binary data payloads.

"Publishing and subscribing for messages on channels with our channel API":/realtime/channels-messages is trivial. Let's get started.

h2. Step 2 - Install Ably

blang[javascript].
  To start using Ably in your web app, you first need to include the Ably library. We recommend that you include the latest client library from our CDN using a simple @<script>@ tag. The client library must be instanced with the API key you copied in Step 1. Note in production we recommend you always use the "token authentication scheme":/general/authentication#token-authentication for browser clients, however in this example we use an API key for simplicity.

  Include the code below just before your closing your HTML @</html>@ tag.

  ```[javascript]
    <!-- Include the latest Ably Library  -->
    <script src="//cdn.ably.io/lib/ably-0.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Instance the Ably library  -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var realtime = new Ably.Realtime(apiKey);
    </script>
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/843128d

blang[nodejs].
  To start using Ably you first need to install the NPM module. The NPM module can be installed as follows:

  ```[sh]
    npm install ably
  ```

  The client library must be instanced with the API key you copied in Step 1. API keys used with "basic authentication":/general/authentication#basic-authentication for your own servers is generally preferred, however clients running on insecure devices should always use the "token authentication scheme":/general/authentication#token-authentication instead. In this example, we use an API key for simplicity.

  Add the following to a file named @example.js@ to instance the Ably library inside your Node.js server:

  ```[nodejs]
    var Ably = require("ably");
    var realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: apiKey });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/f8a9f4a

blang[ruby].
  To start using Ably you first need to install the Ably RubyGem. The RubyGem can be installed as follows:

  ```[sh]
    gem install ably
  ```

  Or if using bundler, simply add the following to your Gemfile and run @bundle install@:

  ```[ruby]
    gem 'ably'
  ```

  The client library must be instanced with the API key you copied in Step 1. API keys used with "basic authentication":/general/authentication#basic-authentication for your own servers is generally preferred, however clients running on insecure devices should always use the "token authentication scheme":/general/authentication#token-authentication instead. In this example, we use an API key for simplicity.

  The Ruby realtime library uses "EventMachine":https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine to run the client library within an asynchronous event loop. However, typically when using Ruby on servers, most developers use the synchronous "REST client library API":/rest. As this turorial needs realtime access to subscribe to messages, it uses the Ruby realtime library.

  Add the following to a file named @example.rb@ to instance the Ably library inside an EventMachine reactor:

  ```[ruby]
    require 'ably'
    EventMachine.run do
      ably = Ably::Realtime.new(key: api_key)
    end
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/0ec2c7e

blang[php].
  To start using Ably you first need to install "composer package on packagist":https://packagist.org/packages/ably/ably-php into your composer.

  ```[sh]
    composer require ably/ably-php --update-no-dev
  ```

  The client library must be instanced with the API key you copied in Step 1. API keys used with "basic authentication":/general/authentication#basic-authentication for your own servers is generally preferred, however clients running on insecure devices should always use the "token authentication scheme":/general/authentication#token-authentication instead. In this example, we use an API key for simplicity.

  PHP Client library doesn't provide realtime api support, so we'll create web app that also uses Javascript to show pub/sub pattern.

  Javascript will handle subscribing to messages, while PHP will be responsible for publishing messages.

  First let's create @ably.php@ where we will store Ably library and Api key

  ```[php]
    <?php
    require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
    $apikey = '{{ApiKey}}';
    $ably   = new \Ably\AblyRest($apikey);
  ```

  Next step is to create frontend of our app, and set up Javascript library. create @index.php@ file with code:

  ```[php]
    <?php
    require_once 'ably.php';
    ?>
    <html>
      <head>
        <script src="https://cdn.ably.io/lib/ably.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Publish & Subscribe sample</h1>
      </body>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        /* Set up a Realtime client which will subscribe to 'sport' channel*/
        var realtime = new Ably.Realtime('<?= $apikey?>');
      </script>
    </html>
  ```

  If you would like to try running the server now, you can do so with @php -S 0.0.0.0:8000@. Once running, open your browser to "http://localhost:8000/":http://localhost:8000/ and you should see "Publish & Subscribe sample".

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/5f96f5f

blang[python].
  To start using Ably you first need to install The REST library for Python, it's "hosted on Github":https://github.com/ably/ably-python and is "published on PyPI":https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ably and can be installed as follows:

  ```[sh]
    pip install ably
  ```

  The client library must be instanced with the API key you copied in Step 1. API keys used with "basic authentication":/general/authentication#basic-authentication for your own servers is generally preferred, however clients running on insecure devices should always use the "token authentication scheme":/general/authentication#token-authentication instead. In this example, we use an API key for simplicity.

  Python Client library doesn't provide realtime api support, so we'll create web app that also uses Javascript to show pub/sub pattern.

  Javascript will handle subscribing to messages, while Python will be responsible for publishing messages.

  "web.py":http://webpy.org/ is a simple web framework for Python. Django is arguably more popular as a web server framework, however for the purposes of this tutorial it is overkill.

  Let's get going with a simple web.py web server now. Install @web.py@ using @pip@:

  ```[sh]
    pip install web.py
  ```

  Now set up a vanilla web.py server in @server.py@:

  ```[python]
    from __future__ import unicode_literals
    from ably import AblyRest
    import web

    apiKey = '{{ApiKey}}'
    client = AblyRest(apiKey)

    render = web.template.render('templates/')


    class index:
        def GET(self):
            return render.index(apiKey)


    urls = (
        '/', index
    )

    app = web.application(urls, globals())

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()
  ```

  In @web.py@ each resource is mapped to a class, which in turn takes action depending on HTTP method used. In this case it's main domain @'/'@, that will be handled by @index@ class, and it will support HTTP @GET@.

  We've used @web.py@ template system to easily pass @apiKey@ to Javascript library, let's create @index.html@ in @templates@ directory:

  ```[html]
    $def with (apiKey)
    <html>
      <head>
        <script src="https://cdn.ably.io/lib/ably.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Publish & Subscribe sample</h1>
      </body>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        /* Set up a Realtime client which will subscribe to 'sport' channel*/
        var realtime = new Ably.Realtime('$apiKey');
      </script>
    </html>
  ```

  h4. Note on string encodings

  Since Ably supports both string and binary payloads, to avoid ambiguity, we recommend that strings passed to the library for publishing to Ably (eg as an event name or payload data) should be unicode strings. In Python 3 this is the normal string type, but in Python 2 it is not, so we suggest you prefix string literals with @u@ prefix (eg @u'eventname'@ - or alternatively, use @from __future__ import unicode_literals@, which will make this automatic), and to explicitly decode any user input (eg @raw_input().decode(sys.stdin.encoding@).

  If you would like to try running the server now, you can do so with @python server.py@. Once running, open your browser to "http://localhost:8080/":http://localhost:8080/ and you should see the text "Publish & Subscribe sample". If you would like to change port, on which your site will be available, simply add it after command ieg. @python server.py 1234@ for port @1234@.

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/f15c86a

h2. Step 3 - Subscribe to messages

Now that the library is installed, you can subscribe to messages published on channels. Every app can have an arbitrary number of channels that should be used to filter the messages received by subscribing clients. For example, if building a news feed, you may want one channel for politics named "politics", and another for sport named "sport". A user interested in "sport" can subscribe to the "sport" channel to receive updates. If that user is not subscribed to the "politics" channel, then "politics" updates will not be delivered to that user.

blang[javascript].
  ```[javascript]
    var channel = realtime.channels.get("sport");
    channel.subscribe(function(msg) {
      alert("Received: " + JSON.stringify(msg.data));
    });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/de53537

blang[nodejs].
  ```[nodejs]
    var channel = realtime.channels.get("sport");
    channel.subscribe(function(msg) {
      console.log("Received: " + JSON.stringify(msg.data));
    });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/334016a

blang[ruby].
  ```[ruby]
    channel = ably.channels.get('sport')
    channel.subscribe do |msg|
      puts "Received: #{msg.data}"
    end
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/75becbf

blang[php].
  Update @index.php@ and add code below before @</script>@ tag:

  ```[javascript]
    var channel = realtime.channels.get("sport");
    channel.subscribe(function(msg) {
      alert("Received: " + JSON.stringify(msg.data));
    });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/bfead9a

blang[python].
  Update @index.html@ and add code below before @</script>@ tag:

  ```[javascript]
    var channel = realtime.channels.get("sport");
    channel.subscribe(function(msg) {
      alert("Received: " + JSON.stringify(msg.data));
    });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/67eb531

h2. Step 4 - Publishing a message

Publishing a message on a channel ensures that any number of subscribers on that channel receive the message in real time. To publish a message on the "sports" channel we simply call the publish method on the channel, specify an optional message event name, and provide the payload as the second argument.

blang[javascript].
  ```[javascript]
    var channel = realtime.channels.get("sport");
    channel.publish("update", { "team": "Man United" });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/140583e

blang[nodejs].
  ```[nodejs]
    var channel = realtime.channels.get("sport");
    channel.publish("update", { "team": "Man United" });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/f831895

blang[ruby].
  ```[ruby]
    channel = ably.channels.get('sport')
    channel.publish 'update', 'team' => 'Man United'
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/212b65b

blang[php].
  Create @publish.php@ file which will be responsible for publishing messages:

  ```[php]
    <?php
    require_once 'ably.php';
    if (isset($_POST['message']) && !empty($_POST['message'])) {
        $channel = $ably->channels->get('sport');
        $channel->publish('update', $_POST['message']);
    }
    ?>
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Input message</h1>
        <form method="post">
          <input type="text" name="message">
          <input type="submit" value="Publish!">
        </form>
      </body>
    </html>
  ```

  And to simplify it even further, let's add @iframe@ so we can see result without the need to switch browser windows. Add code below just after the @<h1>Publish & Subscribe sample</h1>@:

  ```[html]
    <iframe src="publish.php"></iframe>
  ```

  If you would like to try running the server now, you can do so with @php -S 0.0.0.0:8000@. Once running, open your browser to "http://localhost:8000/":http://localhost:8000/ and you should see "Publish & Subscribe sample" and box with "input message", try it out.

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/31ef2e8

blang[python].
  Let's create resource for @/publish@, it will serve as message publisher:

  ```[python]
    class publish:
        def GET(self):
            return render.publish()

        def POST(self):
            message = web.input().get('message')
            if message is not None:
                channel = client.channels.get('sport')
                channel.publish('update', message)
            raise web.seeother('/publish')
  ```

  And create @publish.html@ in @templates@ directory with message form:

  ```[html]
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Input message</h1>
        <form method="post">
          <input type="text" name="message">
          <input type="submit" value="Publish!">
        </form>
      </body>
    </html>
  ```

  And to simplify it even further, let's add @iframe@ so we can see result without the need to switch browser windows. Add code below to @index.html@, just after the @<h1>Publish & Subscribe sample</h1>@:

  ```[html]
    <iframe src="/publish"></iframe>
  ```

  Let's update urls:

  ```[python]
    urls = (
        '/', index,
        '/publish', publish
    )
  ```

  If you would like to try running the server now, you can do so with @python server.py@. Once running, open your browser to "http://localhost:8080/":http://localhost:8080/ and you should see the text "Publish & Subscribe sample" and box with "input message", try it out.

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/948edeb

We're done, it's that simple. We have now shown you how to subscribe to messages on a channel, and then publish messages on a channel. To see this in action, try out the live demo below.
