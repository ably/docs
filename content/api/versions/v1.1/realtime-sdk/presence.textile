h2(#properties).
  default: Presence Properties
  objc,swift: ARTPresence Properties
  ruby: Ably::Realtime::Presence Attributes
  java: io.ably.lib.realtime.Presence Members
  csharp: IO.Ably.Realtime.Presence Properties

The @Presence@ object exposes the following public <span lang="default">properties</span><span lang="ruby">attributes</span><span lang="java">members</span>:

h6(#sync-complete).
  default: syncComplete
  ruby: sync_complete?
  csharp: SyncComplete

A @boolean@ field indicating whether the presence member set is synchronized with server after a channel attach.
When a channel is attached, the Ably service immediately synchronizes the presence member set with the client. Typically this process completes in milliseconds, however when the presence member set is very large, bandwidth constraints may slow this synchronization process down.

h2. Methods

h6(#enter).
  default: enter
  csharp: EnterAsync

In order to enter and be present on a channel, the client must "be identified by having a client ID":https://faqs.ably.com/authenticated-and-identified-clients, "have permission to be present":https://faqs.ably.com/using-capabilities-to-manage-client-access-privileges-on-channels, and be attached to the channel. For simplicity, the library will implicitly attach to a channel when entering. Entering when already entered is treated as an "update":#update.

There are two overloaded versions of this method. <span lang="csharp"></span><span lang="default">
  With both versions, a <span lang="default">callback</span><span lang="ruby">block</span><span lang="java">completion listener</span> can optionally be passed in to be notified of success or failure to enter.
</span>

bq(definition#enter-none).
  default:  enter(callback("ErrorInfo":/api/realtime-sdk/types#error-info err))
  ruby:     "Deferrable":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable enter() -> yields
  java:     void enter("CompletionListener":#completion-listener listener)
  objc,swift: enter(data: nil, callback: ((ARTErrorInfo?) -> Void)?)
  csharp:   Task EnterAsync()

Enter a presence channel without any data. If the channel is @initialized@ (i.e. no attempt to attach has yet been made for this channel), then calling @enter@ will implicitly attach the channel.

bq(definition#enter-data).
  default: enter(Object data, callback("ErrorInfo":/api/realtime-sdk/types#error-info err))
  ruby:    "Deferrable":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable enter(Object data) -> yields
  java:    void enter(Object data, "CompletionListener":#completion-listener listener)
  objc,swift: enter(data: AnyObject?, callback: ((ARTErrorInfo?) -> Void)?)
  csharp:  Task EnterAsync(object clientData)

Enter a presence channel and provide data that is associated with the current present member. If the channel is @initialized@ (i.e. no attempt to attach has yet been made for this channel), then calling @enter@ will implicitly attach the channel.

blang[jsall,objc,swift].
  h4. Callback result

  On successfully updating the data, @err@ is null. On failure to update, @err@ contains an "@ErrorInfo@":#error-info object describing the failure reason.

blang[java].
  h4. Listener result

  On successfully updating the data, the @onSuccess@ method of the "CompletionListener":#completion-listener is called. On failure to update, the @onError@ method is called with an "@ErrorInfo@":#error-info argument describing the failure reason.

blang[csharp].
  h4. Task result

  On successfully entering the channel, the method will complete. On failure to enter, an @AblyException@ will be thrown with an "@ErrorInfo@":#error-info object describing the failure reason. The methods needs to be awaited otherwise the exception won't be thrown.

blang[ruby].
  h4. Returns

  A "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable object is returned from the method.

  On successfully updating the data, the registered success blocks for the "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable and any block provided to the method are executed. On failure to update, the @errback@ callbacks of the "@Deferrable@":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable are called with an "@ErrorInfo@":#error-info argument describing the failure reason.

h6(#get).
  default: get
  csharp: Get

Get the current presence member set for this channel. Typically, this method returns the member set immediately as the member set is retained in memory by the client. However, by default this method will wait until the presence member set is synchronized, so if the synchronization is not yet complete following a channel being attached, this method will wait until the presence member set is synchronized.

When a channel is attached, the Ably service immediately synchronizes the presence member set with the client. Typically this process completes in milliseconds, however when the presence member set is very large, bandwidth constraints may slow this synchronization process down.

When a channel is @initialized@ (i.e. no attempt to attach has yet been made for this channel), then calling @get@ will implicitly attach the channel.

bq(definition).
  default: get(Object options, callback("ErrorInfo":/api/realtime-sdk/types#error-info err, "PresenceMessage[]":#presence-message members))
  ruby:    "Deferrable":/api/realtime-sdk/types#deferrable get(Hash options) -> yields "PresenceMessage[]":#presence-message
  java:    "PresenceMessage[]":#presence-message get("Param":#param[] options)

  ruby:     subscribe → yields "PresenceMessage":#presence-message
  objc,swift: subscribe(callback: ("ARTPresenceMessage":#presence-message) -> Void) -> ARTEventListener
  csharp:   void Subscribe(Action<PresenceMessage> handler)

- <div lang="csharp">handler</div> := called with each matching "@presence message@":#presence-message when received on the channel

h4. Considerations

* If the channel is @initialized@ (i.e. no attempt to attach has yet been made for this channel), then calling @subscribe@ will implicitly attach the channel. However, regardless of the implicit attach outcome, the <span lang="default">listener</span><span lang="ruby">block</span><span lang="csharp">handler</span> will still be registered
* If @subscribe@ is called more than once with the same <span lang="default">listener</span><span lang="ruby">block</span><span lang="csharp">handler</span>, then duplicates will be registered. For example, if you @subscribe@ twice with the same <span lang="default">listener</span><span lang="ruby">block</span><span lang="csharp">handler</span> and a presence message is later received, the same <span lang="default">listener</span><span lang="ruby">block</span><span lang="csharp">handler</span> will be invoked twice
* The registered <span lang="default">listener</span><span lang="ruby">block</span><span lang="csharp">handler</span> remains active on the presence channel regardless of the underlying channel state. For example, if you call @subscribe@ when the underlying channel is @attached@ and it later becomes @detached@ or even @failed@, when the channel is reattached and a presence message is received, the <span lang="default">listeners</span><span lang="ruby">blocks</span><span lang="csharp">handlers</span> originally registered will still be invoked. Listeners are only removed when calling "@unsubscribe@":#unsubscribe or when the underlying channel is @released@ using the <span lang="default">@Realtime.channels.release(name)@</span><span lang="csharp">@Realtime.Channels.Release(name)@</span> method
* If an exception is thrown in the subscribe listener and bubbles up to the event emitter, it will be caught and logged at @error@ level, so as not to affect other listeners for the same event

  default: enterClient
  ruby: enter_client
  csharp: EnterClientAsync

Enter this presence channel for the given <span lang="default">@clientId@</span><span lang="ruby">@client_id@</span><span lang="csharp">@ClientId@</span>. This method is provided to support typically server instances that act on behalf of multiple client IDs. See "Managing multiple client IDs":/realtime/presence#presence-multiple-client-id for more info. In order to be able to publish presence changes for arbitrary client IDs, the client library must have been instantiated either with an "API key":https://faqs.ably.com/what-is-an-app-api-key, or with a "token bound to a wildcard client ID":https://faqs.ably.com/can-a-client-emulate-any-client-id-i.e.-authenticate-using-a-wildcard-client-id.

There are two overloaded versions of this method.
<span lang="csharp"></span><span lang="default">
