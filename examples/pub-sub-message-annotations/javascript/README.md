## Getting started

1. Clone the [Ably docs](https://github.com/ably/docs) repository where this example can be found:

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:ably/docs.git
  ```

2. Change directory:

  ```sh
  cd /examples/
  ```

3. Rename the environment file:

  ```sh
  mv .env.example .env.local
  ```

4. In `.env.local` update the value of `VITE_ABLY_KEY` to be your Ably API key.

5. Install dependencies:

  ```sh
  yarn install
  ```

6. Run the server:

  ```sh
  yarn run pub-sub-message-annotations-javascript
  ```

7. Try it out by opening two tabs to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) with your browser to see the result.

## Open in CodeSandbox

In CodeSandbox, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and update the value of your `VITE_ABLY_KEY` variable to use your Ably API key.
