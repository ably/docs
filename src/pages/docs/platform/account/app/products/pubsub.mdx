The Pub/Sub section in your Ably dashboard provides a centralized hub for managing realtime messaging across your application. From this overview page, you can quickly access getting started guides for different platforms, explore ready-to-use examples, and review recent product updates through the changelog.

The dashboard makes it easy to jump into channel monitoring, review implementation patterns, and stay updated with the latest Pub/Sub features and fixes.

## Channels <a id="channels"/>

The channels interface serves as your primary dashboard for monitoring and managing all pub/sub messaging activity across your application. This section provides real-time visibility into channel performance, connection patterns, and message flow, enabling you to quickly identify issues and optimize your messaging implementation.

Navigate to the channels section through the dashboard sidebar under Products > Pub/Sub > Channels. The main channels view displays all active channels in a clean, searchable interface that makes it easy to monitor your entire messaging infrastructure at a glance.

### Channel browser functionality

The channel finder search box allows you to quickly locate specific channels by name - essential when managing applications with numerous channels across different features or namespaces. Simply enter a channel name or partial match to filter the results and find the channels you need to inspect.

The interface shows exactly how many channels are currently active with the • Showing: 11 of 11 • counter, giving you immediate awareness of your application's messaging scope and helping you track channel growth over time.

Each channel entry in the list displays key information for rapid assessment:

| Column | Information displayed | Purpose | Action available |
|---|---|---|---|
| Channel name | The full identifier for the messaging channel | Identify specific channels and namespaces | Click to sort alphabetically |
| Connection count | Real-time number of clients currently connected | Monitor traffic patterns and detect issues | Compare across channels |
| Inspect button | Eye icon for detailed channel access | Access advanced monitoring and configuration | Click to view analytics, history, and settings |

The connection count column is particularly valuable for identifying channels experiencing high traffic, unusual activity patterns, or potential connection issues. Channels with unexpectedly high or low connection counts can indicate performance problems, client-side issues, or changes in user behavior that need investigation.

## Channel inspection <a id="inspection"/>

When you click the inspect button (eye icon) next to any channel in the channels list, you access a comprehensive channel monitoring interface that provides deep visibility into that specific channel's behavior, performance, and configuration.

### Channel inspection overview

The inspection page opens with a detailed overview showing critical channel information and real-time metrics. The header displays the full channel name with a copy button for easy reference, along with breadcrumb navigation back to the main channels list.

#### Live analytics and visualization

The inspection interface provides two primary analytics sections with live, updating charts that help you understand channel behavior over time.

##### Messages analytics

The messages chart displays real-time inbound and outbound message flow with color-coded tracking for different message types. Use this to identify message patterns and delivery bottlenecks.

##### Occupancy analytics

The occupancy chart tracks connections, publishers, subscribers, and presence members over time. Use this data to understand user engagement patterns and optimize your messaging architecture.

#### Channel configuration and rules

The rules section provides comprehensive configuration options for controlling channel behavior and security requirements. You can configure three categories of rules:

| Rule category | Purpose | Configuration options |
|---|---|---|
| Storage rules | Control message persistence and history retention | Persist last message, persist all messages |
| Channel rules | Enforce security requirements | Identification required, TLS required |
| Feature rules | Enable advanced capabilities | Push notifications, message annotations/updates/deletes |

#### Integrations

The integrations section allows you to connect channels to external services and configure automated workflows triggered by channel activity.

Use the **Add integration** button to set up new external connections.

#### Live logs and debugging

The live logs section provides essential debugging capabilities through real-time event monitoring and error tracking.

| Log type | Description |
|---|---|
| API requests | Monitor REST API calls and authentication attempts |
| Channels | Track channel creation, configuration changes, and lifecycle events |
| Connections | Monitor client connections, disconnections, and connection state changes |
| Integration errors | Identify webhook failures, external service timeouts, and integration issues |

When the logs display • No logs found • with • No active logs to display • this indicates normal channel operation without errors or notable events. During active debugging or high-traffic periods, you'll see real-time event streams that help diagnose issues and verify system behavior.

## Connections <a id="connections"/>

The connections tab provides detailed visibility into all clients currently connected to your channel, enabling you to monitor individual connection behavior and troubleshoot client-specific issues.

### Connection overview

When you select the connections tab from the channel inspection interface, you'll see a comprehensive list of all active connections to that specific channel. The interface displays key connection information in an organized table format.

The following outlines the connection information displayed:

| Column | Information displayed | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Connection ID | Unique identifier for each client connection | Track and reference specific connections |
| Client ID | Application-defined client identifier | Identify clients in your application logic |
| Country | Geographic location of the connection | Monitor regional usage patterns |
| SDK | Client SDK version and platform | Debug compatibility and version issues |

The connection list shows practical information such as • Showing: 2 of 2 • to indicate the total number of active connections. Each connection entry includes an inspect button (eye icon) for detailed connection analysis.

### Individual connection inspection

When you click the inspect button on any connection, you access a detailed connection monitoring interface that provides comprehensive information about that specific client's behavior and configuration.

| Activity metric | Information displayed | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Inbound message rate | Messages per second sent by this client | Monitor client publishing activity |
| Outbound message rate | Messages per second delivered to this client | Track message delivery to client |

The activity chart visualizes message flow over time with separate tracking for inbound and outbound messages, helping you identify usage patterns and potential issues for individual connections.

#### Live logs

The live logs section shows real-time events specific to this connection, including connection establishment, message activity, and any errors:

| Log detail | Information displayed | Purpose |
