Single sign-on (SSO) enables your users to authenticate via any SAML-compatible identity provider.

h2(#configure). Configure

Single sign-on is restricted to Enterprise customers only and must be enabled on a per-account basis by "contacting Ably":https://ably.com/contact. Only "account owners":/account/users can configure SSO for an account.

Any SAML-compatible identity provider can be used to enable SSO.

The following instructions are examples of configuring SSO with "Okta":#okta and "Google Workspace":#google.

h3(#okta). Okta

To enable SSO using "Okta":https://www.okta.com/ as the identity provider, configure the following properties in your Ably account dashboard and your Okta account:

In your Ably account dashboard:

1. Log in to your "account":https://ably.com/accounts/any.
2. Select *Settings* from the account navigation dropdown.
3. Toggle *Enable Single Sign-On* under the *Authentication Settings* section.
4. Note down the *Single sign-on URL* and *Audience URI* values.

In your Ably account dashboard:

1. Log in to your "account":https://ably.com/accounts/any.

h2(#strict). Strict mode

Strict mode can be enabled to restrict access to your Ably account to only those users that authenticate with your identity provider. Users that attempt to log in using another method, such as their email address and password or a GitHub log in will be prompted to re-authenticate with your identity provider.

Strict mode ensures that Ably account access is handled by your identity provider. If a user is removed from your identity provider they will no longer be able to access the Ably account once their current session expires.

<aside data-type='important'>
<p>Account owners can access account resources regardless of their current authentication method.</p>
</aside>

To enable strict mode:

1. Log in to your "account":https://ably.com/accounts/any.
2. Select *Settings* from the account navigation dropdown.
3. Toggle *Enable Strict Mode* under the *Authentication Settings* section. This setting is only visible if SSO has been enabled.
