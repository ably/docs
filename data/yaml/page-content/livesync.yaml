      LiveSync enables you to synchronize changes in your database to frontend clients at scale. LiveSync is database agnostic but currently only supports PostgreSQL in its early access version. It uses Ably's global message delivery network to sync user data in realtime.

      LiveSync is made up of two components: the Database Connector and the Models SDK. The Database Connector is a backend service that enables you to broadcast real-time changes from your database. Additionally, the Models SDK is a frontend library that simplifies subscribing to changes in data models and applying optimistic updates, merging them with confirmed updates.
