- clientId := a clientId to filter by<br>__Type: @String@__

- deviceClientId := a client ID associated with a device to filter by<br>__Type: @String@__

- <div lang="swift,objc">callback</div> := called with a "ARTPaginatedResult":#paginated-result<"PushChannelSubscription":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/push-admin#push-channel-subscription> object or an error

- <div lang="jsall">params</div> := An optional object containing key-value pairs to filter subscriptions by. Can contain @clientId@, @deviceId@ or a combination of both, and a @limit@ on the number of subscriptions returned, up to 1,000<br>__Type: @Record<string, string>@__

blang[jsall].
  h4. Returns

  Returns a promise. On success, the promise is fulfilled with "@PaginatedResult@":#paginated-result which encapsulates an array of "PushChannelSubscription":#push-channel-subscription objects corresponding to the current page of results. "@PaginatedResult@":#paginated-result supports pagination using "@next@":#paginated-result and "@first@":#paginated-result methods. On failure, the promise is rejected with an "@ErrorInfo@":/docs/api/realtime-sdk/types#error-info object that details the reason why it was rejected.
