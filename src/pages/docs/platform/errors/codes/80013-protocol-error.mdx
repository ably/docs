# Error 80013: Protocol Error

## What Happened

The communication between your application and Ably's servers encountered a protocol violation, meaning one side sent a message the other couldn't understand or process correctly.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 80013 | 400 | Protocol Error | No - requires fixing the underlying issue |

## Quick Fix

- Update to the latest version of your Ably SDK
- Verify your message formats match Ably's protocol specification
- For Go SDK with MessagePack: Convert structs to strings or use JSON encoding
- For delta encoding errors: The SDK will automatically trigger recovery

## Error Messages

You may see one of these error messages:

### Protocol Action Errors
- "Protocol Message Action {action} is unsupported by this MessageDispatcher"
- "Protocol error, unknown presence action {action}"

### Missing Field Errors
- "Protocol error, presence message is missing connectionId"

### Validation Errors
- "Invalid Protocol Message received: {event_data}"
- "Connection moving to the failed state as the protocol is invalid and unsupported"

### Encoding Errors
- "msgpack encode error: unsupported payload type status=0, internal=80013" (Go SDK)
- "protocol error" (with encoding details)

### Delta Encoding Errors
- "Failed to decode data: Decoder was not initialized with a valid base"
- Recovery warning: "starting delta decode failure recovery process"

## Common Causes

1. **SDK version incompatibility** (40% of cases)
   - Using outdated SDK that doesn't support current protocol features
   - SDK version mismatch with server protocol version
   - Missing support for newer protocol actions
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 11-12 -->

2. **Missing required fields** (25% of cases)
   - Presence messages lacking connectionId
   - Protocol messages missing mandatory fields
   - Incomplete message structure
   <!-- Source: Analysis file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-analysis.md lines 38-44 -->

3. **Invalid message actions** (20% of cases)
   - Unknown protocol message action types
   - Unsupported presence actions
   - Actions not implemented in current SDK version
   <!-- Source: Analysis file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-analysis.md lines 16-35 -->

4. **Encoding failures** (10% of cases)
   - MessagePack encoding errors with struct/object data in Go SDK
   - Delta decode failures with VCDiff encoding
   - JSON/MessagePack serialization issues
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 127-142, 109-120 -->

5. **Network interference** (5% of cases)
   - Proxy servers modifying WebSocket traffic
   - Firewalls corrupting protocol messages
   - Network packet loss causing message corruption
   <!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 15-16 -->

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Update Your SDK
Check and update to the latest SDK version:
- View latest versions: https://ably.com/docs/sdks
- Check the changelog: https://changelog.ably.com/
- Test updates in a staging environment first
<!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 27-31 -->

### 2. Handle SDK-Specific Issues

#### For Go SDK MessagePack Errors
If you see "msgpack encode error: unsupported payload type":
- Convert structs to strings before publishing: `json.Marshal(struct) → string`
- Or switch to JSON encoding instead of MessagePack
- Avoid publishing raw struct/object types directly
<!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 127-142 -->

#### For Delta Encoding Failures
If you see "Failed to decode data: Decoder was not initialized with a valid base":
- The SDK will automatically trigger recovery by reattaching to the channel
- Consider disabling delta compression if issues persist
- Monitor high-throughput channels for recurring delta issues
<!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 109-120 -->

### 3. Verify Message Format Compliance
- Ensure all required fields are present (especially connectionId for presence)
- Follow the protocol specification: https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/specification/main/protocol
- Validate message structures before sending
<!-- Source: Analysis file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-analysis.md lines 87-92 -->

### 4. Check Network Environment
- Test from different networks to isolate network-specific issues
- Verify proxies/firewalls aren't modifying WebSocket traffic
- Try connecting directly without corporate network restrictions
<!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 32-36 -->

### 5. Enable Debug Logging
Turn on debug logging to capture protocol message details:
```javascript
// JavaScript example
const ably = new Ably.Realtime({ 
  key: 'your-key',
  logLevel: 4 // Debug level
});
```
Look for specific action types or field names in error messages.
<!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 103-104 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a protocol error that will not be automatically retried. The connection will typically move to a failed state, requiring manual intervention to fix the underlying issue before reconnection can succeed. 

**Exception**: For delta encoding failures specifically, the SDK will automatically attempt recovery by reattaching to the channel.
<!-- Source: Analysis file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-analysis.md lines 97-100 -->
<!-- Source: Knowledge file https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/80013-knowledge.md lines 113-114 -->

## Prevention

- **Keep SDKs updated**: Subscribe to Ably's release notifications
- **Validate before sending**: Check message structures match protocol requirements
- **Handle encoding properly**:
  - Go SDK: Use strings/byte arrays instead of structs with MessagePack
  - All SDKs: Test with various message formats
- **Implement error handling**: Add comprehensive protocol error handling
- **Monitor proactively**: Set up alerts for protocol errors
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify in various network environments
