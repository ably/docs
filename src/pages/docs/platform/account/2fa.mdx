Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an authentication process requiring users to utilize two different forms of verification. 2FA for your Ably account requires your password and a security token sent to your mobile phone.

Access your [account settings](https://ably.com/accounts/any/user/edit) to configure two-factor authentication for your Ably account.

To enable 2FA for your own user login:

1. Log in to your [account](https://ably.com/accounts/any).
2. Select **Profile settings** from the user profile dropdown.
3. Toggle **Enable Two-Factor Authentication** under the **Two-factor authentication** section.
    * Re-enter your password as prompted.
4. Select your **Country**.
5. Enter your **Phone number**
6. Click **Next** to receive an SMS with a security token.
7. Enter the security token and click **Verify security code**.
8. Scan the QR code into an authenticator app such as Authy, or Google Authenticator.
9. Store your recovery codes in a safe location.

### Disable 2FA <a id="disable"/>

To disable 2FA for your own user login:

1. Log in to your [account](https://ably.com/accounts/any).
2. Select **Profile settings** from the user profile dropdown.

## Enforce 2FA for all users <a id="enforce"/>

[Account owners](/docs/platform/account/users) can require 2FA to be utilized by all users. Any user that hasn't already enabled 2FA will be prompted to do so the next time they attempt to access the account.

The account owner must already have 2FA enabled for their own login before they can enforce it account-wide.
