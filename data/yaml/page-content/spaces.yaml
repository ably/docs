      Spaces enables you to build collaborative environments in your application.

      It provides high-level APIs for managing the data related to members collaborating synchronously in an application, such as their online status, or the position of their cursors. This is also known as participant state. Each API is optimized based on the payload structure and frequency of updates that are anticipated for that feature.
