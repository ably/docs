Ably provides multiple interfaces and SDKs to suit different use cases, platforms, and requirements. This guide helps you choose the right approach for your application.

## Overview

When building with Ably, you need to make decisions at two levels:

1. **Which interface**: REST, Realtime, or protocol adapters
2. **Which abstraction level**: Raw Pub/Sub or a purpose-built SDK (Chat, Spaces, LiveObjects, LiveSync)

The right choice depends on your application's requirements for latency, connection persistence, and the complexity of the features you're building.

## REST vs Realtime interface

Ably SDKs contain both a REST and a Realtime interface. Each serves different use cases.

### REST interface

The REST interface communicates with Ably using HTTP and is effectively stateless. It does not maintain a persistent connection to Ably.

Use the REST interface when you need to:

* Publish messages from a server without receiving updates
* Issue tokens on behalf of other clients
* Retrieve message history, presence history, or application statistics
* Perform occasional, request-response style operations
* Minimize resource usage in environments where persistent connections are impractical

The REST interface is more commonly used server-side. It is more efficient if you don't need to establish a persistent connection to Ably, such as when you have a server publishing messages to channels that doesn't need to receive any updates from them.

### Realtime interface

The Realtime interface uses an Ably-defined protocol, primarily over WebSockets, to establish and maintain a persistent connection to Ably. The Realtime interface extends the functionality of the REST interface.

Use the Realtime interface when you need to:

* Subscribe to messages in realtime
* Maintain a persistent connection to Ably
* Attach to one or more channels and publish and subscribe to messages
* Register presence on a channel, or listen for others present in realtime
* Publish at very high message rates, or with the lowest possible latencies
* Benefit from automatic reconnection and connection state recovery

The Realtime interface is most commonly used client-side. Subscribing to messages is only available through the Realtime interface because it requires establishing a persistent connection to Ably in order to receive messages in realtime.

### Comparison

| Aspect | REST interface | Realtime interface |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Protocol | HTTP | WebSockets (primarily) |
| Connection | Stateless, no persistent connection | Persistent, maintained connection |
| Subscribing | Not supported | Supported |
| Publishing | Supported | Supported |
| Presence | History retrieval only | Full realtime presence |
| Latency | Higher (request-response) | Lower (persistent connection) |
| Resource usage | Lower | Higher |
| Typical use | Server-side | Client-side |
| Connection recovery | Not applicable | Automatic |

### When to use each

| Scenario | Recommended interface |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| Server publishing events to clients | REST |
| Issuing authentication tokens | REST |
| Retrieving message or presence history | REST |
| Client receiving live updates | Realtime |
| Chat application | Realtime |
| Live dashboard | Realtime |
| Presence and online indicators | Realtime |
| IoT device sending sensor data | REST or Realtime (depending on frequency) |
| Backend webhook processing | REST |

## Purpose-built SDKs vs Pub/Sub

Ably provides purpose-built SDKs that abstract away the complexity of building common realtime features. These SDKs are built on top of Pub/Sub and benefit from all the same platform guarantees.

### Pub/Sub

[Pub/Sub](/docs/basics) is Ably's core product. It provides flexible, low-level APIs for publishing and subscribing to messages on channels. Use Pub/Sub when you need full control over your message architecture or are building custom realtime features.

Use Pub/Sub when:

* You need maximum flexibility in message structure and channel design
* You're building custom realtime features not covered by purpose-built SDKs
* You need to integrate with existing backend systems
* Your use case doesn't fit neatly into chat, collaboration, or shared state patterns

### Chat SDK

[Ably Chat](/docs/chat) provides purpose-built APIs for building chat functionality. It handles the complexities of architecting chat features so you don't have to.

Use the Chat SDK when you're building:

* 1:1 customer support chat
* Group conversations
* Livestream chat with thousands of users
* Any application requiring rooms, messages, typing indicators, reactions, or presence

The Chat SDK provides:

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Rooms](/docs/chat/rooms) | Organize users and messages into chat rooms |
| [Messages](/docs/chat/rooms/messages) | Send and receive messages within rooms |
| [Presence](/docs/chat/rooms/presence) | Display who is currently online in a room |
| [Typing indicators](/docs/chat/rooms/typing) | Show when users are typing |
| [Message reactions](/docs/chat/rooms/reactions) | Enable reactions to specific messages |
| [Room reactions](/docs/chat/rooms/room-reactions) | Broadcast ephemeral sentiments to a room |
| [AI Moderation](/docs/chat/moderation) | Automatically detect inappropriate content |

### Spaces SDK

[Ably Spaces](/docs/spaces) provides high-level APIs for building collaborative environments where users work together in realtime.

Use the Spaces SDK when you're building:

* Interactive whiteboards with live cursors
* Collaborative document editing
* Avatar stacks showing online users
* Applications with component locking to prevent edit conflicts

The Spaces SDK is optimized for participant state, which is largely ephemeral and doesn't need to be stored. This is distinct from application state, which must be validated and stored in your database.

The Spaces SDK provides:

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Space](/docs/spaces/space) | Virtual area for realtime collaboration |
| [Avatar stack](/docs/spaces/avatar) | Show online status of users |
| [Member locations](/docs/spaces/locations) | Track where users are in your application |
| [Live cursors](/docs/spaces/cursors) | Display cursor positions in realtime |
| [Component locking](/docs/spaces/locking) | Optimistically lock UI components before editing |

### LiveObjects

[Ably LiveObjects](/docs/liveobjects) provides a simple API for managing shared state that is synchronized in realtime across multiple users or devices.

Use LiveObjects when you're building:

* Realtime voting and polling systems
* Live leaderboards
* Multiplayer game state synchronization
* Collaborative applications with shared counters or maps
* AI agent state tracking

LiveObjects handles synchronization, persistence, and conflict resolution automatically.

### LiveSync

[Ably LiveSync](/docs/livesync) synchronizes your database state to frontend clients in realtime.

Use LiveSync when:

* Your database is the source of truth for application state
* You need to reflect database changes to clients in realtime
* You're using PostgreSQL or MongoDB

### Choosing between abstractions

| Use case | Recommended product |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Chat rooms, messaging, reactions | Chat SDK |
| Collaborative cursors, avatars, locking | Spaces SDK |
| Shared counters, maps, synchronized state | LiveObjects |
| Database-to-client synchronization | LiveSync |
| Custom realtime features | Pub/Sub |
| Maximum flexibility and control | Pub/Sub |

When a purpose-built SDK exists for your use case, prefer it over building the same functionality with raw Pub/Sub. The SDKs handle edge cases, optimize for their specific payload patterns, and reduce the amount of code you need to write and maintain.

## SDKs vs protocol adapters

[Ably SDKs](/docs/sdks) are the recommended method for connecting to Ably. They provide comprehensive feature support including automatic connection management, authentication token renewal, and presence.

[Protocol adapters](/docs/protocols) offer an alternative for specific scenarios where SDKs are impractical.

### When to use SDKs

Use an Ably SDK when:

* An SDK is available for your platform
* You need the full set of Ably features
* You want automatic connection recovery and token renewal
* You're building a production application

### When to use protocol adapters

Consider protocol adapters when:

* You're running on resource-constrained devices with limited memory
* No Ably SDK is available for your platform (such as Arduino-based IoT devices)
* You're migrating from Pusher or PubNub and want a gradual transition
* You have stringent memory restrictions and only need to subscribe to events

Available protocol adapters:

| Protocol | Best for |
| -------- | -------- |
| [MQTT](/docs/protocols/mqtt) | IoT devices, constrained environments |
| [SSE](/docs/protocols/sse) | Subscribe-only clients, browser streaming |
| [Pusher Adapter](/docs/protocols/pusher) | Migration from Pusher |
| [PubNub Adapter](/docs/protocols/pubnub) | Migration from PubNub |

Protocol adapters do not support the full set of Ably features. For example, the MQTT protocol adapter does not support presence, and the SSE protocol adapter does not support automatic token renewal.

## REST HTTP API vs SDK REST interface

Ably provides a [REST HTTP API](/docs/api/rest-api) that you can use directly without an SDK.

### When to use the SDK REST interface

Use the REST interface of an Ably SDK when:

* You need REST functionality with additional resilience features
* You want automatic re-routing around network problems via alternative datacenters
* You prefer a language-idiomatic API

### When to use the REST HTTP API directly

Use the REST HTTP API directly when:

* No Ably SDK is available for your platform
* You have specific resource constraints
* You need to make arbitrary API calls that SDKs don't yet support

Ably recommends using SDK REST interfaces where possible. SDKs provide additional features that improve performance and resilience that the REST HTTP API cannot deliver on its own, such as automatic re-routing around network problems by using alternative datacenters.

## Combining SDKs for custom features

Purpose-built SDKs like Chat and Spaces are built on top of the Ably Pub/Sub SDK. This architecture means you can use multiple SDKs together, leveraging the high-level abstractions where they fit your needs while dropping down to Pub/Sub for custom features.

### Accessing the underlying Realtime client

The Chat and Spaces SDKs expose the underlying Ably Realtime client that powers them. This client is the same one you would use directly with Pub/Sub, giving you access to all of its functionality.

There are several benefits to this architecture:

* [Authentication](/docs/auth) and [connection management](/docs/connect) are handled by the underlying SDK
* You maintain a single connection to Ably rather than multiple connections
* You can extend your application's functionality with custom Pub/Sub features alongside the purpose-built SDK

### When to combine SDKs

Combine a purpose-built SDK with Pub/Sub when:

* The SDK covers most of your requirements but lacks a specific feature
* You need to build custom functionality that integrates with SDK-managed features
* You want to publish or subscribe to custom channels alongside SDK-managed channels

### Example use cases

The following are examples where combining the Chat SDK with Pub/Sub is effective:

| Feature | Approach |
| ------- | -------- |
| File attachments | Use Chat SDK for messages, Pub/Sub for file upload notifications and metadata |
| Custom notifications | Use Chat SDK for conversations, Pub/Sub channels for system-wide alerts |
| Read receipts | Use Chat SDK for messaging, Pub/Sub for custom read receipt events |
| Integrations | Use Chat SDK for user-facing chat, Pub/Sub to publish events to backend services |

### How it works in practice

When you initialize a Chat or Spaces client, it creates or accepts an underlying Ably Realtime client. You can use this client directly to:

* Attach to custom channels outside of SDK-managed rooms or spaces
* Publish messages with custom event types
* Subscribe to channels for features the SDK doesn't provide
* Access presence on channels not managed by the SDK

This approach lets you start with a purpose-built SDK for rapid development, then extend with Pub/Sub only where needed. You avoid rebuilding features that the SDK already handles well, while retaining the flexibility to customize your application.

### Best practices

When combining SDKs with Pub/Sub:

* **Use consistent authentication**: Let the purpose-built SDK manage authentication and share its Realtime client rather than creating separate clients
* **Avoid duplicating SDK features**: If the Chat SDK provides typing indicators, use them rather than building your own on Pub/Sub
* **Namespace your custom channels**: Use a clear naming convention to distinguish custom Pub/Sub channels from SDK-managed channels
* **Consider message ordering**: Messages on SDK-managed channels and custom Pub/Sub channels are independent; design your application accordingly
* **Handle connection state once**: The underlying Realtime client manages connection state; don't add redundant connection handling for custom features
