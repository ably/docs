## Scenario

- **Event duration:** 1 hour
- **Users in chat:** 5,000
- **Per user:** 5 chat messages, 2 reactions

**Total cost: $94.50**

## Cost breakdown

The following breakdown shows the cost of connections, channels and messages in this scenario.

## How total number of messages are counted

Every chat message and reaction counts as a billable message. Messages are counted when they're sent to Ably and when they're delivered to users.

One message sent to a room with 5,000 subscribers = 5,001 messages (the sender of the message also receives it).

### Messages generated by this scenario

| Message type       | Calculation                              | Messages    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Messages sent      | 5,000 × (5 messages + 2 reactions per user) | 35,000   |
| Messages delivered | 35,000 messages × 5,000 users            | 175,000,000 |
| **Total messages** | 35,000 messages + 175,000,000 messages   | 175,035,000 |

## Reduce message costs with server-side batching

With Ably's [server-side batching](https://ably.com/docs/channels/options/batching), messages published within a short window (for example 500ms) are grouped and delivered together. With a 500ms window, that's 7,200 batches per hour, with each batch being charged as one billable message.

This reduces the number of published messages which is the main cost driver in large rooms. In this scenario, batching reduces the total billed message volume by 79%.

### Without batching cost

| Total messages | Messages Calculation | Cost calculation               | Total cost |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|------------|
| 175,035,000    | As above             | 175,035,000 × $2.50/M messages | $440.00    |

### With batching messages

| Delivery method    | Calculation              | Total messages |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Messages sent      | 35,000 messages × 1      | 35,000         |
| Messages delivered | 7,200 batches × 5,000    | 36,000,000     |
| **Total messages** | 35,000 + 36,000,000      | 36,035,000     |

### With batching cost

| Total messages | Messages Calculation | Cost calculation              | Total cost |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| 175,035,000    | As above             | 36,035,000 × $2.50/M messages | $92.50     |

## How connection and channel minutes are counted

Both connection minutes and channel minutes are rounded up per million minutes used.

**Connection minutes:**

[Connection minutes](https://ably.com/docs/pricing) are billed based on how long a user remains connected to Ably for.

| Item               | Calculation                  | Total       |
|--------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| Connection minutes | 5,000 participants × 60 mins | 300,000 mins |
| Cost               | 300,000 × $1.00/M            | $1.00       |

**Channel minutes:**

[Channel minutes](https://ably.com/docs/pricing) are billed based on how long channels are active for. Traffic is all over a single channel in this scenario.

| Item            | Calculation    | Total   |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Channel minutes | 1 × 60 mins    | 60 mins |
| Cost            | 60 × $1.00/M   | $1.00   |

> **Note:** A channel is equivalent to a room
