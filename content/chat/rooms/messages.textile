You can send and receive messages in a chat room with any number of participants. These users subscribe to messages by registering a listener, and send messages to all users that are subscribed to receive them.

h2(#subscribe). Subscribe to messages

Subscribe to receive messages in a room by registering a listener. Use the "@messages.subscribe()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_js.Messages.html#subscribe method in a room to receive all messages that are sent to it:

```[javascript]
const {unsubscribe} = room.messages.subscribe((message) => {
  console.log(message);
});
```

h3(#structure). Message structure

The following is the structure of a message:

```[json]
{
  "timeserial": "e91RB0GOQBcvyJ53053074@1718191654749-0",
  "clientId": "basketLover014",
  "roomId": "basketball-stream",
  "text": "What a shot!",
  "headers": {},
  "metadata": {},
  "createdAt": "2024-06-12T11:37:59.988Z",
}
```

The following are the properties of a message:

|_. Property |_. Description |_. Type |
| timeserial | An Ably-generated ID used to determine the order the message was sent in. | String |
| clientId | The client identifier of the user that sent the message. | String |
| roomId | The name of the room the message was sent to. | String |
| text | The message contents. | String |
| headers | Optional headers for adding additional information to a message, such as the relative timestamp of a livestream video, or flagging a message as important. Do not use the headers for authoritative information. There is no server-side validation. When reading headers treat them like user input. | Object |
| metadata | Optional additional metadata about the message, such as animations, effects or links to other resources such as images. This information is not read by Ably. Do not use metadata for authoritative information. There is no server-side validation. When reading metadata treat it like user input. | Object |
| createdAt | The time the message was sent. | Date |

h3(#unsubscribe). Unsubscribe from messages

Unsubscribe from messages to remove previously registered listeners.

Use the "@unsubscribe()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_js.MessageSubscriptionResponse.html#unsubscribe function returned in the @subscribe()@ response to remove a listener:

```[javascript]
// Initial subscription
const { unsubscribe } = room.messages.subscribe((message) => console.log(message));

// To remove the listener
unsubscribe();
```

Use the "@messages.unsubscribeAll()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_js.Messages.html#unsubscribeAll method to deregister all chat message listeners in a room:

```[javascript]
await room.messages.unsubscribeAll();
```

<aside data-type='note'>
<p>There is a difference between unsubscribing from messages and detaching from a room that is important to understand. </p>
<p>Messages are sent to users as soon as they "attach":/chat/rooms#attach to a room, irrespective of whether a listener has been registered by calling @subscribe()@. Calling @unsubscribe()@ only deregisters the listener.</p>
<p>The "@detach()@":/chat/rooms#detach method detaches a user from the room. At that point a user will no longer receive any messages that are sent to the room.</p>
</aside>

h2(#send). Send a message

Use the "@messages.send()@":https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/ably-chat-js/main/typedoc/interfaces/chat_js.Messages.html#send method to send a message in a chat room. All users that are "subscribed":#subscribe to messages on that room will receive it:

```[javascript]
await room.messages.send('hello');
```
