# Error 92000: LiveObjects validation error

## What Happened

A LiveObjects operation failed validation due to invalid data, missing state, or synchronization issues.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 92000 | 500 | Server Error (LiveObjects) | No - requires fixing validation issue |

## Quick Fix

- Validate object IDs before operations
- Ensure objects exist before updates
- Handle state synchronization errors
- Consider resynchronizing LiveObjects state

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Invalid serial: {serial}"
- "Invalid site code: {siteCode}"
- "Missing object state; LiveCounter objectId={id}"
- "Missing object state; LiveMap objectId={id}"
- "Invalid object id string"

## Common Causes

1. **Invalid Object ID** (40% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92000-analysis.md lines 44-50 -->
   - Malformed object ID string
   - Invalid format or characters
   - Attempting to parse corrupted ID

2. **Missing Object State** (30% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92000-analysis.md lines 29-42 -->
   - Object not yet synchronized
   - State lost during disconnection
   - Attempting operations on non-existent objects

3. **Invalid Operation Sequencing** (20% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92000-analysis.md lines 13-27 -->
   - Invalid serial number in operation
   - Invalid site code
   - Out-of-order operations

4. **Synchronization Issues** (10% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 36-42 -->
   - Network partitions causing state divergence
   - Race conditions between concurrent operations
   - State corruption during synchronization

## Resolution Steps

1. **Validate object IDs before operations**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 57-63 -->
   - Check ID format is valid
   - Ensure ID exists in your system
   - Verify ID hasn't been corrupted

2. **Check object existence**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 26-30 -->
   - Verify the LiveObject exists before operations
   - Wait for initial synchronization to complete
   - Handle missing state gracefully

3. **Implement error recovery**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge advice from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 65-82 -->
   - Detect 92000 errors in catch blocks
   - Clear local LiveObjects state
   - Fetch fresh state from server
   - Retry the operation after resynchronization

4. **Monitor operation ordering**
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92000-analysis.md lines 63-67 -->
   - Ensure operations have valid serial numbers
   - Check site codes are correct
   - Handle concurrent operations properly

## Automatic Handling

This error indicates a validation failure that cannot be automatically resolved. Your application must handle the error by fixing the validation issue or resynchronizing state.

## Prevention

- **Validate inputs**: Always validate object IDs and data before operations
  <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92000-knowledge.md lines 84-89 -->
- **Handle disconnections**: Implement proper state recovery after connection loss
- **Use idempotent operations**: Design operations to be safely retryable
- **Monitor errors**: Track validation errors to identify patterns
