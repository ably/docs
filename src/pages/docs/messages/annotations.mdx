title: Message annotations
meta_description: "Annotate messages on a channel with additional metadata."
---

<Aside data-type='experimental'>
Message annotations are currently Experimental, meaning the API or behaviour may change in response to customer feedback without a major SDK release.
</Aside>

Message annotations enable clients to append information to existing messages on a channel. You can use annotations to implement features like:

* **Message reactions** - add emoji reactions (üëç, ‚ù§Ô∏è, üòÇ) to messages
* **Content categorization** - tag messages with categories such as "important" or "urgent"
* **Community moderation** - flag inappropriate content for review
* **Read receipts** - mark messages as "read" or "delivered"
* **Comments** - clients can comment on a message, which will not show up in normal channel history, but which can be loaded on demand

When clients publish or delete an annotation, Ably automatically creates a [summary](#annotation-summaries) that provides an aggregated view of all annotations for the associated message.

## Enable annotations <a id="enable"/>

Annotations can be enabled for a channel or channel namespace with the *Message annotations, updates, and deletes* channel rule.

<Aside data-type='important'>
When message annotations are enabled, messages are [persisted](/docs/storage-history/storage#all-message-persistence) regardless of whether or not persistence is enabled, in order to support the feature. This may increase your usage since [we charge for persisting messages](https://faqs.ably.com/how-does-ably-count-messages).

[Continuous history](/docs/storage-history/history#continuous-history) features are not supported. Be aware that if you are currently using continuous history and enable annotations, updates, and deletes, continuous history will no longer function.
</Aside>

1. Go to the **Settings** tab of an app in your dashboard.
3. Under [channel rules](/docs/channels#rules), click **Add new rule**.
4. Enter the channel name or channel namespace on which to enable message annotations.
5. Check **Message annotations, updates, and deletes** to enable message annotations.
6. Click **Create channel rule** to save.

## Annotation types <a id="annotation-types"/>

Annotation types determine how annotations are processed and aggregated into [summaries](#annotation-summaries).

The annotation type is a string of the format `namespace:summarization.version` where:

* `namespace` is a string (e.g. `reactions`) that groups related annotations. Only annotations in the same namespace will be aggregated to produce [summaries](#annotation-summaries).
* `summarization` specifies how annotations are aggregated to produce [summaries](#annotation-summaries), such as `total`, `flag`, `distinct`, `unique`, or `multiple`.
* `version` specifies the version component which allows for future changes to summarization behavior.

### Total

The `total.v1` summarization method counts the number of annotations of a given type that were published for a message.

Deleting an annotation decrements the total count for that message.

Using `total.v1` does not attribute counts to individual clients in the summary; it maintains only a simple count per annotation type and does not organize counts by name. [Unidentified](/docs/auth/identified-clients#unidentified) clients can publish `total.v1` annotations. Use the [identified channel rule](/docs/channels#rules) if you want to prevent unidentified clients from publishing annotations.

If the same client publishes an annotation of a given type to the same message twice, the `total` count is incremented twice.

<Code>
```json
{
  "metrics:total.v1": {
    "total": 42
  }
}
```
</Code>

### Flag

The `flag.v1` summarization method counts how many distinct clients have published an annotation of a given type and maintains a list of those `clientId`s. Clients must be [identified](/docs/auth/identified-clients) to publish `flag.v1` annotations.

Deleting an annotation decrements the total count for that message and removes the `clientId` from the list of clients that contributed to the summary.

A given client can contribute to the summary only once per annotation type.

<Code>
```json
{
  "reactions:flag.v1": {
    "total": 3,
    "clientIds": ["client1", "client2", "client3"],
    "clipped": false
  }
}
```
</Code>

### Distinct

The `distinct.v1` summarization method counts how many unique clients have published an annotation with a given `name` for each annotation type along with the corresponding list of `clientId`s that published it. Clients must be [identified](/docs/auth/identified-clients) to publish `distinct.v1` annotations.

A given client can contribute to the summary for a particular annotation `name` only once, but the same client may publish additional annotations with different `name`s.

Deleting an annotation removes the `clientId` from the list of clients that contributed to the summary for that `name`, and decrements the total count for that `name`.

<Code>
```json
{
  "categories:distinct.v1": {
    "important": {
      "total": 2,
      "clientIds": ["client1", "client3"],
      "clipped": false
    },
    "urgent": {
      "total": 3,
      "clientIds": ["client1", "client2", "client3"],
      "clipped": false
    }
  }
}
```
</Code>

### Unique

The `unique.v1` summarization method counts how many unique clients have published an annotation with a given `name` for each annotation type, while guaranteeing that each client contributes to the summary for only one `name` at a time. The summary for each annotation `name` holds a `total` count of the number of distinct clients that have published an annotation with that `name` along with the corresponding list of `clientId`s that published it. Clients must be [identified](/docs/auth/identified-clients) to publish `unique.v1` annotations.

A given client can contribute to the summary for a particular annotation `name` only once. Publishing an annotation with a different `name` automatically removes that client from the summary for the previous `name` and adds them to the new one, updating the affected total values and list of `clientId`s.

Deleting an annotation removes the `clientId` from the list of clients that contributed to the summary for that `name`, and decrements the total count for that `name`.

<Code>
```json
{
  "status:unique.v1": {
    "important": {
      "total": 2,
      "clientIds": ["client1", "client3"],
      "clipped": false
    },
    "urgent": {
      "total": 1,
      "clientIds": ["client2"],
      "clipped": false
    }
  }
}
```
</Code>

### Multiple

The `multiple.v1` summarization method counts both a total and a per-client count of the number of annotations that were published with a given `name` for each annotation type. Additionally it includes a count for the number of annotations published with a given `name` from unidentified clients. Use the [identified channel rule](/docs/channels#rules) if you want to prevent unidentified clients from publishing annotations.

A given client can contribute to the summary for a particular annotation `name` multiple times. The same client may also publish additional annotations with different `name`s.

If a client specifies a `count` when publishing an annotation, the client's contribution to the summary is incremented by the specified value. If not, it defaults to incrementing by 1.

Deleting an annotation removes all contributions made by that `clientId` for that `name`.

<Code>
```json
{
  "voting:multiple.v1": {
    "option-a": {
      "total": 7,
      "clientCounts": {
        "client1": 3,
        "client2": 2
      },
      "totalUnidentified": 2,
      "clipped": false,
      "totalClientIds": 2
    },
    "option-b": {
      "total": 4,
      "clientCounts": {
        "client1": 2,
        "client3": 1
      },
      "totalUnidentified": 1,
      "clipped": false,
      "totalClientIds": 2
    }
  }
}
```
</Code>

## Publish annotations <a id="publish" />

To publish an annotation for a message, use the `annotations.publish()` method on a channel. Pass in either a [message](/docs/messages) instance or the `serial` of the message to annotate. This method will publish an annotation with the action `annotation.create`.

Certain annotation summarization methods require a client to be [identified](/docs/auth/identified-clients) for them to be able to publish an annotation. Their `clientId` will then be included in the associated published annotation.

Specify the [annotation type](#annotation-types) using the `type` field of the annotation object.

<Code>
```javascript
// Create an Ably Realtime client specifying the clientId that will
// be associated with annotations published by this client
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}', clientId: 'my-client-id' });

// Create a channel in a namespace called `annotations`
// which has message annotations enabled
const channel = realtime.channels.get('annotations:example');

// Publish an annotation for a message that flags it as delivered
await channel.annotations.publish(message, {
  type: 'receipts:flag.v1',
  name: 'delivered'
});

// You can also use a message's `serial`
await channel.annotations.publish(message.serial, {
  type: 'receipts:flag.v1',
  name: 'delivered'
});
```

```nodejs
// Create an Ably Realtime client specifying the clientId that will
// be associated with annotations published by this client
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}', clientId: 'my-client-id' });

// Create a channel in a namespace called `annotations`
// which has message annotations enabled
const channel = realtime.channels.get('annotations:example');

// Publish an annotation for a message that flags it as delivered
await channel.annotations.publish(message, {
  type: 'receipts:flag.v1',
  name: 'delivered'
});

// You can also use a message's `serial`
await channel.annotations.publish(message.serial, {
  type: 'receipts:flag.v1',
  name: 'delivered'
});
```
</Code>

In the case of the `distinct`, `unique`, or `multiple` aggregation types, you should also specify a `name`. For these types, each different name will be aggregated separately in the [annotation summary](#annotation-summaries).

In the case of the `multiple` aggregation type, you should specify both a `name` and a `count`, by which to increment a client's contribution to the summary.

<Code>
```javascript
await channel.annotations.publish(message.serial, {
  type: 'rating:multiple.v1',
  name: 'stars',
  count: 4
});
```

```nodejs
await channel.annotations.publish(message.serial, {
  type: 'rating:multiple.v1',
  name: 'stars',
  count: 4
});
```
</Code>

You can additionally specify a `data` payload when publishing an annotation. This is not included in an annotation summary, so only readable by [clients that are subscribed to individual annotation events](#individual-annotations).

## Delete annotations <a id="delete" />

To delete an annotation, use the `annotations.delete()` method on a channel. Pass in either a [message](/docs/messages) instance or the `serial` of the message to annotate. This method will publish an annotation message with an action of `annotation.delete`.

Deleting an annotation does not remove the original annotation that was published. Instead, the deletion modifies the [annotation summary](#annotation-summaries) for that message by removing the contribution specified by the annotation.

The `clientId` specified in the [client options](/docs/api/realtime-sdk#client-options) will be associated with the published delete annotation.

Specify the [annotation type](#annotation-types) using the `type` field of the annotation object, and optionally specify a `name` for the annotation. The `name` is used to aggregate certain annotations when producing an annotation summary.

<Code>
```javascript
// Create an Ably Realtime client specifying the clientId that will
// be associated with annotations published by this client
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}', clientId: 'my-client-id' });

// Create a channel in a namespace called `annotations`
// which has message annotations enabled
const channel = realtime.channels.get('annotations:example');

// Delete a 'delivered' annotation
await channel.annotations.delete(message.serial, {
  type: 'receipts:flag.v1',
  name: 'delivered'
});
```

```nodejs
// Create an Ably Realtime client specifying the clientId that will
// be associated with annotations published by this client
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}', clientId: 'my-client-id' });

// Create a channel in a namespace called `annotations`
// which has message annotations enabled
const channel = realtime.channels.get('annotations:example');

// Delete a 'delivered' annotation
await channel.annotations.delete(message.serial, {
  type: 'receipts:flag.v1',
  name: 'delivered'
});
```
</Code>

## Subscribe to annotation summaries <a id="subscribe" />

The simplest way to receive annotation updates is via annotation summaries. A message that has annotations also includes a summary which is a synopsis of certain details of all annotations for that message. Summaries are updated in response to further annotation events for that message, and summary changes are delivered by default to subscribing clients.

Annotation summaries are delivered to subscribers as messages with an `action` of `message.summary`, and a `serial` matching the `serial` of the message that they are updating. They have an `annotations` field which contains a `summary` of all the annotations for the message.

The value of that `summary` field is an object where the keys are the [annotation types](#annotation-types). The structure of the value of each key depends on the summarization method used, for example `total.v1` will have a `total` field, while `flag.v1` will have `total` and `clientIds` fields.

<Aside data-type='note'>
Subscribing to annotations uses the same method as [subscribing to regular messages](/docs/pub-sub#subscribe) on a channel. When using message annotations, regular messages delivered to the `subscribe()` listener will have an `action` of `message.create`.
</Aside>

<Code>
```javascript
// Create an Ably Realtime client specifying the clientId that will
// be associated with annotations published by this client
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}', clientId: 'my-client-id' });

// Create a channel in a namespace called `annotations`
// which has message annotations enabled
const channel = realtime.channels.get('annotations:example');

await channel.subscribe((message) => {
  if (message.action === 'message.summary') {
    console.log(message.annotations.summary);
  }
});
```

```nodejs
// Create an Ably Realtime client specifying the clientId that will
// be associated with annotations published by this client
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}', clientId: 'my-client-id' });

// Create a channel in a namespace called `annotations`
// which has message annotations enabled
const channel = realtime.channels.get('annotations:example');

await channel.subscribe((message) => {
  if (message.action === 'message.summary') {
    console.log(message.annotations.summary);
  }
});
```
</Code>

### Annotation summaries <a id="annotation-summaries"/>

When annotations for a message are published, Ably automatically generates a summary that provides an aggregated view of all annotations for that message.

A separate summary is produced for each distinct [annotation type](#annotation-types). The summarization method specified in the annotation type determines how annotations in the same namespace for a given message are aggregated into a summary. A summary is constructed from the set of [individual annotation events](#individual-annotations) (annotation messages with an `action` of `annotation.create` or `annotation.delete`).

The summary will be included in a `summary` field nested within the message's `annotations` field, and is an object whose keys are the annotation types and whose values describe the annotation summary for that type. For example:

<Code>
```json
{
  "metrics:total.v1": {
    "total": 42
  },
  "reactions:flag.v1": {
    "total": 3,
    "clientIds": ["client1", "client2", "client3"],
    "clipped": false
  },
  "categories:distinct.v1": {
    "important": {
      "total": 2,
      "clientIds": ["client1", "client3"],
      "clipped": false
    },
    "urgent": {
      "total": 3,
      "clientIds": ["client1", "client2", "client3"],
      "clipped": false
    }
  },
  "status:unique.v1": {
    "important": {
      "total": 2,
      "clientIds": ["client1", "client3"],
      "clipped": false
    },
    "urgent": {
      "total": 1,
      "clientIds": ["client2"],
      "clipped": false
    }
  },
  "voting:multiple.v1": {
    "option-a": {
      "total": 7,
      "clientCounts": {
        "client1": 3,
        "client2": 2
      },
      "totalUnidentified": 2,
      "clipped": false,
      "totalClientIds": 2
    },
    "option-b": {
      "total": 4,
      "clientCounts": {
        "client1": 2,
        "client3": 1
      },
      "totalUnidentified": 1,
      "clipped": false,
      "totalClientIds": 2
    }
  }
}
```
</Code>

### Large summaries <a id="large-summaries"/>

If many clients publish the same annotation to the same message, the list of client IDs in that annotation summary will get clipped in order to keep the event size within the maximum message size.

When a summary is clipped:
- The `total` property shows the total number of annotations as expected, but the `clientIds` property will contain only a partial list of client IDs.
- The `clipped` property is set to `true`.
- For the `multiple` annotation type, use the `totalClientIds` property to determine the total number of clients that have published the annotation. For the other annotation types this is equal to `total`.

## Subscribe to individual annotation events <a id="individual-annotations"/>

It is also possible to subscribe to individual annotation events, as distinct from annotation summaries. These are the emitted when [publishing](#publish) or [deleting](#delete) an annotation.

Summaries are designed to address the most common usecases for annotations, so there is usually no need to subscribe to individual annotation events. However, subscribing to individual annotations is appropriate for usecases where the payload of individual annotation events is relevant to the application.

If you need to, you can subscribe to individual annotation events using the `annotations.subscribe()` method on a channel. To subscribe to individual annotations, you must request the `ANNOTATION_SUBSCRIBE` [mode](/docs/channels/options#modes).

<Aside data-type='note'>
When you provide an explicit `modes` property for a channel, you override the set of [default modes](/docs/channels/options#modes). It is likely that you will be using features other than just annotations on the channel, so ensure that you also include the other `modes` that you require.
</Aside>

Annotations delivered to the `annotations.subscribe()` listener will have an `action` of `annotation.create` or `annotation.delete`.

<Code>
```javascript
// Create an Ably Realtime client specifying the clientId that will
// be associated with annotations published by this client
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}', clientId: 'my-client-id' });

// Create a channel in a namespace called `annotations`
// which has message annotations enabled.
// Specify the ANNOTATION_SUBSCRIBE mode to enable annotation subscriptions.
const channel = realtime.channels.get('annotations:example', { modes: ['ANNOTATION_SUBSCRIBE', ... /* all other modes you need, such as MESSAGE_SUBSCRIBE */] });

await channel.annotations.subscribe((annotation) => {
  if (annotation.action === 'annotation.create') {
    console.log(`New ${annotation.type} annotation with name ${annotation.name} from ${annotation.clientId}`);
  } else if (annotation.action === 'annotation.delete') {
    console.log(`${annotation.clientId} deleted a ${annotation.type} annotation with name ${annotation.name}`);
  }
});
```

```nodejs
// Create an Ably Realtime client specifying the clientId that will
// be associated with annotations published by this client
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}', clientId: 'my-client-id' });

// Create a channel in a namespace called `annotations`
// which has message annotations enabled.
// Specify the ANNOTATION_SUBSCRIBE mode to enable annotation subscriptions.
const channel = realtime.channels.get('annotations:example', { modes: ['ANNOTATION_SUBSCRIBE'] });

await channel.annotations.subscribe((annotation) => {
  if (annotation.action === 'annotation.create') {
    console.log(`New ${annotation.type} annotation with name ${annotation.name} from ${annotation.clientId}`);
  } else if (annotation.action === 'annotation.delete') {
    console.log(`${annotation.clientId} deleted a ${annotation.type} annotation with name ${annotation.name}`);
  }
});
```
</Code>

### Annotation message properties <a id="annotation-properties"/>

Annotations are a special type of message with the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| id | An Ably-generated ID used to uniquely identify the annotation. |
| action | The action specifies whether this is an annotation being added (`annotation.create`) or removed (`annotation.delete`). |
| serial | This annotation's unique serial (lexicographically totally ordered). |
| messageSerial | The serial of the message that this annotation is annotating. |
| type | The [annotation type](#annotation-types). |
| name | The name of the annotation, used by some [annotation types](#annotation-types) for aggregation. |
| clientId | The client identifier of the user that published this annotation. |
| count | An optional count, only relevant to certain [annotation types](#annotation-types). |
| data | An optional payload for the annotation. Available on an [individual annotation](#individual-annotations) but not aggregated or included in [annotation summaries](#annotation-summaries). |
| encoding | This is typically empty, as all annotations received from Ably are automatically decoded client-side using this value. However, if the annotation encoding cannot be processed, this attribute contains the remaining transformations not applied to the `data` payload. |
| timestamp | The timestamp of when the annotation was received by Ably, as milliseconds since the Unix epoch. |
