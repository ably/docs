## Install <a id="install"/>

The React UI Kit is built on top of the Ably Chat SDK and requires both the Ably Pub/Sub SDK and the Chat SDK to be installed.

### NPM <a id="npm"/>

Install the required packages:

<Code>
```shell
  npm install ably @ably/chat @ably/chat-react-ui-kit
```
</Code>

Import the packages into your project:

<Code>
```react
  import * as Ably from 'ably';
  import { ChatClient } from '@ably/chat';
  import { ChatClientProvider } from '@ably/chat/react';
  import { App, ChatWindow, Sidebar, ThemeProvider, AvatarProvider, ChatSettingsProvider } from '@ably/chat-react-ui-kit';
  import '@ably/chat-react-ui-kit/dist/style.css';
```
</Code>

## Configure the Chat SDK <a id="configure-chat-sdk"/>

To use the React UI Kit, you need to configure the Ably Chat client. This involves creating an instance of the `ChatClient` and passing it to the `ChatClientProvider`.

For more information on how to configure the Ably Chat client, see the [Ably Chat SDK documentation](/docs/chat/setup).

## Setup providers <a id="setup-providers"/>

The React UI Kit relies on several context providers to function properly. These providers manage state, theming, avatars, and chat settings.

### Basic provider setup <a id="basic-provider-setup"/>

Set up the required providers in your application's entry point:

<Code>
```react
  import * as Ably from 'ably';
  import { ChatClient } from '@ably/chat';
  import { ChatClientProvider } from '@ably/chat/react';
  import { ThemeProvider, AvatarProvider, ChatSettingsProvider } from '@ably/chat-react-ui-kit';
  import '@ably/chat-react-ui-kit/dist/style.css';

  // Create Ably Realtime client
  const ablyClient = new Ably.Realtime({
    key: '{{API_KEY}}', // Replace with your Ably API key
    clientId: '<clientId>',
  });

  const chatClient = new ChatClient(ablyClient);

  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <ThemeProvider>
        <AvatarProvider>
          <ChatSettingsProvider>
            <ChatClientProvider client={chatClient}>
              {/* Your components will go here */}
            </ChatClientProvider>
          </ChatSettingsProvider>
        </AvatarProvider>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </React.StrictMode>
  );
```
</Code>

## Next steps <a id="next-steps"/>

Now that you have set up the React UI Kit, you can:

* Learn more about the available [Components](/docs/chat/react-ui-kit/components)
* Explore the [Providers and Hooks](/docs/chat/react-ui-kit/providers) for managing state
* Check out the [getting started guide](/docs/chat/getting-started/react-ui-kit) for a complete example
