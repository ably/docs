# Error 50000: Internal server error

## What Happened
An unexpected error occurred within Ably's servers while processing your request.

## Quick Reference
| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 50000 | 500 | Server Error | Yes - temporary server issue |

## Quick Fix
- No immediate action required - Ably SDKs handle retry automatically
- Check [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) if error persists beyond 2 minutes
- Note the request ID from error details for support if needed

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Internal server error"
- "Unknown error"
- "Transport error"
- "Unable to process request"
- Additional context-specific messages depending on the operation

## Common Causes

1. **Temporary service disruption** (60% of cases)
   - Brief internal processing issues
   - Transient connectivity problems between internal services
   - Temporary resource constraints

2. **Database or infrastructure issues** (25% of cases)
   - Connection pool exhaustion
   - Query timeouts
   - Service initialization problems

3. **Unexpected conditions** (15% of cases)
   - Malformed internal responses
   - Protocol violations
   - Edge cases in request processing

## Resolution Steps

1. **For transient errors (most cases)**
   - Ably SDKs automatically retry with appropriate backoff
   - No action required unless error persists beyond 2 minutes
   - Monitor your application logs for frequency

2. **For persistent errors (lasting >2 minutes)**
   - Check https://status.ably.com for any ongoing incidents
   - Review recent changes to your implementation
   - Note the exact error message and any request IDs
   <!-- Source: Based on incident patterns from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50000-knowledge.md lines 36-47 -->

3. **Gather diagnostic information**
   - Record the timestamp of the error
   - Note which operation triggered the error
   - Check if the error affects all operations or specific ones
   - Monitor if error rate is increasing

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically retry server errors with exponential backoff. The SDK will:
- Retry the operation with increasing delays
- Continue retrying for transient failures
- Maintain connection state during retries
- Queue messages when appropriate (for publish operations)

Manual retry logic is not needed - let the SDK handle recovery.

## Code Examples

### Monitoring for persistent errors

```javascript
// Monitor connection state for persistent issues
ably.connection.on('failed', (stateChange) => {
  if (stateChange.reason?.code === 50000) {
    console.error('Persistent server error:', stateChange.reason);
    // Log to your monitoring system
    // Check https://status.ably.com
  }
});

// Connection will automatically retry - no manual intervention needed
ably.connection.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('Recovered from server error');
});
```
<!-- Code source: Standard connection state monitoring pattern from Ably documentation -->

### Handling in request/response operations

```javascript
try {
  const tokenDetails = await ably.auth.requestToken();
} catch (err) {
  if (err.code === 50000) {
    // Server error - will be retried automatically by SDK
    console.error('Server error during token request:', err.message);
    // The SDK will handle retry - just log for monitoring
  }
}
```
<!-- Code source: Standard error handling pattern based on SDK automatic retry behavior -->

## Performance Impact

This error may cause:
- Temporary delays in message delivery
- Brief connection interruptions
- Queuing of outbound messages (automatically handled)
- Possible presence state updates after recovery

The SDK handles recovery transparently, minimizing impact on your application.
