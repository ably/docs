Ably provides the flexibility to migrate from Pusher progressively or all at once. The fastest we’ve seen someone migrate is a few hours.

Our protocol adapter takes care of all the background translation, you simply change your API key. You can also use a Pusher client library via this adapter to work on some platforms for which no Ably client library SDK is available.

</a>

Full usage notes for the adapter are available separately in a support article: "Using the Ably Pusher Protocol Adapter":https://faqs.ably.com/using-the-ably-pusher-protocol-adapter.

To take advantage of "Ably features not supported by the Pusher client libraries":https://ably.com/compare/ably-vs-pusher such as "connection state recovery":https://faqs.ably.com/connection-state-recovery you’ll need to fully migrate over to Ably. But in this tutorial, we'll see how you can get started using the Pusher protocol adapter.

<%= partial partial_version('tutorials/_step-1-create-app-and-api-key') %>

h2.
  default: Step 2 - enable Pusher protocol support

# "Log into your app dashboard":https://faqs.ably.com/how-do-i-access-my-app-dashboard
# Under "Your apps", click on "Manage app" for any app you wish to use for this tutorial, or create a new one with the "Create New App" button
# Click on the "Settings" tab
# Scroll down to "Protocol Adapter Settings"
# Tick the "Pusher protocol support" checkbox
# Click 'Save settings'

The dashboard will offer to set up some namespaces for you. Pusher public channels will use the Ably @public:@ namespace, private channels will use the Ably @private:@ namespace, and presence channels will use the Ably @presence:@ namespace. Click "Create default namespaces" to set these up, which will let you change settings, such as whether messages are persisted, for each namespace.

h4. Note on Security

Normally, you cannot connect to the Ably service at all without a complete API key, or a token derived from one. When Pusher protocol support is enabled, you can connect to public channels with only the Ably key name. So you should only enable Pusher support on an app if you're using Pusher client libraries with that app.

h2.
  default: Step 3 - Point your client libraries to Ably

blang[javascript].
  You'll need to modify the client library initializer by replacing your Pusher app key with the part of your Ably API key before the @:@ (so if your API key is @appid.keyid:keysecret@, you'd use @appid.keyid@). You'll also need to add some things to the options object, as follows:

  ```[javascript]
    var pusher = new Pusher('appid.keyid', {
      wsHost       : 'realtime-pusher.ably.io',
      httpHost     : 'realtime-pusher.ably.io',
      disableStats : true,
      encrypted    : true
    });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/dc5019e

  These are in addition to whatever options you were using already, such as @authEndpoint@.

blang[nodejs].
  You'll need to modify the client library initializer by replacing your Pusher app key with the part of your Ably API key before the @:@ (so if your API key is @appid.keyid:keysecret@, you'd use @appid.keyid@), and the Pusher secret with the part of your API key after the @:@. You'll also need to add a few other things to the initializer, as follows. Note that this example is for the Pusher node REST library; if using the realtime library, even in node, select 'javascript' from the 'Show tutorial in:' bar above.

  ```[javascript]
    var pusher = new Pusher({
      appId     : 'appid',
      key       : 'appid.keyid',
      secret    : 'keysecret',
      host      : 'rest-pusher.ably.io',
      encrypted : true
    });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/e916654

blang[ruby].
  You'll need to modify the client library initializer by replacing your Pusher app key with the part of your Ably API key before the @:@ (so if your API key is @appid.keyid:keysecret@, you'd use @appid.keyid@), and the Pusher secret with the part of your API key after the @:@. You'll also need to add a few other things to the initializer, as follows.

  ```[ruby]
    Pusher::Client.new(
      app_id:    'appid',
      key:       'appid.keyid',
      secret:    'keysecret',
      host:      'rest-pusher.ably.io',
      encrypted: true
    )
  ```

If we don't have an example in the language you'll be using, check the "Pusher documentation for that library":https://pusher.com/docs/channels/channels_libraries/libraries to find the equivalent options to the ones in the javascript example (for realtime libraries) or the ruby or nodejs example (for REST libraries) above.

h2.
  default: Step 4 - interoperability between Pusher and Ably client libraries

Behind the scenes, the adapter uses the normal Ably service, so you can use Pusher and Ably client libraries side by side, and they'll interoperate seamlessly. The main thing you need to be aware of is channel name translation.

Ably and Pusher both have various (incompatible) restrictions on channel names, and use namespaces very differently. So when using the adapter, channel names are mapped. For example if you connect to the channel "foo" using the Pusher adapter, it will actually use the Ably channel "public:foo"; and if you want to communicate with the Pusher client library from an Ably client library, it would need to connect to that channel.

The translation rules are as follows:

* Pusher public channels (no prefix) are mapped to the the Ably @public:@ namespace.
* Pusher private channels (@private-@ prefix) are mapped to the the Ably @private:@ namespace.
* Pusher presence channels (@presence-@ prefix) are mapped to the the Ably @presence:@ namespace.
* Ably channels not in any of the @public:@, @private:@, or @presence:@ namespaces get a @private-ablyroot-@ prefix when seen from a Pusher client.
* Colons are banned in Pusher channel names, but are important in Ably channel names, as they act as the namespace separator. So the adapter maps semicolons to colons: semicolons in Pusher channel names become colons in Ably channel names, and vice versa. (This means you will not be able to access any Ably channels which have semicolons in their name).

A few examples:

|_. Pusher adapter channel |_. Actual Ably channel |
| presence-foo              |  presence:foo     |
| private-foo               |  private:foo      |
| foo                       |  public:foo       |
| foo;bar                   |  public:foo:bar   |
| private-ablyroot-foo      |  foo              |
| private-ablyroot-foo;bar  |  foo:bar          |

h5. Interoperability example

blang[javascript].
  Here's some code that subscribes to a channel from the Pusher client library, then publishes to it from the Ably client library:

  ```[javascript]
    /* Subscribe to the 'some_channel' channel. This is actually an
     * Ably channel called 'public:some_channel' */
    var channel = pusher.subscribe('some_channel');
    channel.bind('message_name', function(data) {
      alert("Received a message: " + JSON.stringify(data));
    });

    /* Publish a message with the Ably client */
    var ablyChannel = ably.channels.get('public:some_channel');
    ablyChannel.publish('message_name', { 'some': ['JSON', 'data'] });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/07671a2

blang[nodejs].
  Here's some code that subscribes to a channel from the Ably node client library, then publishes to it from the Pusher node client library:

  ```[javascript]
    /* Subscribe to the 'public:some_channel' channel with the Ably client */
    const ablyChannel = ably.channels.get('public:some_channel');
    ablyChannel.subscribe(function(message) {
      console.log('Ably client received a message: ' + message.name + ', data: ' + JSON.stringify(message.data));
    });

    /* Publish to the 'some_channel' channel with the Pusher client.
     * This is a public channel, so the real channel name is 'public:some_channel' */
    pusher.trigger('some_channel', 'eventName', { 'Some': 'JSON data' });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/7105d2b

blang[ruby].
  Here's some code that subscribes to a channel from the Ably ruby client library, then publishes to it from the Pusher ruby client library:

  ```[ruby]
    # Subscribe to the 'public:some_channel' channel with the Ably client
    ablyChannel = ably.channels.get('public:some_channel')
    ablyChannel.subscribe do |message|
      puts "Ably client received a message: #{message.name} - #{message.data.inspect}"
    end

    # Publish to the 'some_channel' channel with the Pusher client.
    # This is a public channel, so the real channel name is 'public:some_channel'
    pusher.trigger('some_channel', 'event_name', {some: 'data sent by the Pusher client library'})
  ```
