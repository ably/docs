When working with Ably's realtime infrastructure, your application may encounter various error codes that help identify and resolve issues. This comprehensive reference provides detailed information about all error codes across Ably's platform and SDKs.

Each error code follows a consistent format with specific ranges indicating the error category. The error messages and behavior are consistent across all Ably SDKs, making it easier to debug issues regardless of your chosen platform. For example, error 40012 always indicates an invalid client ID issue, whether you're using JavaScript, Python, Ruby, or any other SDK.

## Core Pub/Sub Messaging

**[0: Generic client error](/docs/platform/errors/codes/0-generic-client-error)** <a id="0"></a>  
The SDK encountered an error during client-side validation or a generic error condition occurred where no specific error code was available.

**[1: Unknown error](/docs/platform/errors/codes/1-unknown-error)** <a id="1"></a>  
The SDK encountered an error code from the Ably service that it doesn't recognize, typically indicating a version mismatch between your SDK and the API.

**[40000: Bad request](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40000-bad-request)** <a id="40000"></a>  
Your request cannot be processed because it doesn't meet Ably's requirements - this could be due to invalid parameters, wrong connection state, missing prerequisites, or protocol violations.

**[40001: Invalid request body](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40001-invalid-request-body)** <a id="40001"></a>  
The request sent to Ably contains invalid, malformed, or incomplete data that cannot be processed.

**[40003: Invalid Parameter Value](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40003-invalid-parameter-value)** <a id="40003"></a>  
A parameter in your request contains an invalid value that doesn't meet Ably's requirements.

**[40004: Invalid header](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40004-invalid-header)** <a id="40004"></a>  
The server rejected your request due to an invalid or malformed header value that couldn't be parsed or validated.

**[40006: Invalid connection ID](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40006-invalid-connection-id)** <a id="40006"></a>

**[40011: Stale ring state or invalid data payload](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40011-stale-ring-state)** <a id="40011"></a>  
This error has two distinct causes: either the channel enumeration API encountered a cluster state change during pagination, or a message contained an unsupported data type.

**[40013: Invalid message data or encoding](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40013-invalid-message-data-or-encoding)** <a id="40013"></a>  
The SDK cannot encode or decode your message because the data type is unsupported or the encoding process failed.

**[40014: Resource disposed](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40014-resource-disposed)** <a id="40014"></a>  
The operation failed because the requested resource (such as a channel, connection, or internal component) has already been disposed or closed.

**[40018: Delta decode failure](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40018-delta-decode-failure)** <a id="40018"></a>  
The SDK couldn't decode a delta-compressed message, which means the channel needs to reattach to restore message continuity.

**[40019: Missing Plugin](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40019-missing-plugin)** <a id="40019"></a>  
The SDK requires a plugin or module that isn't installed or included in your build.

**[90003: Unable to recover channel (messages expired)](/docs/platform/errors/codes/90003-unable-to-recover-channel)** <a id="90003"></a>  
Channel recovery failed because the messages needed for recovery have expired and are no longer available in Ably's message history

**[90004: Message Limit Exceeded](/docs/platform/errors/codes/90004-message-limit-exceeded)** <a id="90004"></a>

**[40101: Invalid credentials](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40101-invalid-credentials)** <a id="40101"></a>  
Your authentication credentials are invalid, incorrectly formatted, or cannot be verified by Ably's authentication system.

**[40102: Incompatible credentials](/docs/platform/errors/codes/40102-incompatible-credentials)** <a id="40102"></a>  
Your authentication credentials contain mismatched or incompatible information that prevents a successful connection.
