All interactions between a client and the Ably service must be authenticated.

## Recommended authentication <a id="recommended"/>

| Environment | Recommended Method | Details |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Client-side** (browsers, mobile apps) | [Token authentication](/docs/auth/token) | Your server creates Ably Tokens (JWT format recommended for most apps); clients use `authCallback` to fetch them |
| **Server-side** (Node.js, Python, etc.) | [Basic authentication](/docs/auth/basic) | Use your API key directly in trusted environments |

<Aside data-type='important'>
**Never use API keys in client-side code.** API keys don't expire. Once compromised, they grant indefinite access. Use [token authentication](/docs/auth/token) with tokens that can have narrowly-scoped capabilities, can be short-lived, and can be revoked.
</Aside>

### Quick start

<Code>
```javascript
// Client-side: fetch token from your server
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime({
  authCallback: async (tokenParams, callback) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/ably-token');
    callback(null, await response.text());
  },
});
```
</Code>

See [JWT authentication](/docs/auth/jwt#scenario-standard) for complete server and client examples.

## Authentication terminology <a id="terminology"/>

- **Authentication**: The process of verifying credentials (API key or token) to allow interaction with Ably.
- **Authorization**: Determining what operations an authenticated client can perform, based on [capabilities](/docs/auth/capabilities).
- **Identified client**: A client with a verified identity (`clientId`). See [identified clients](/docs/auth/identified-clients).

## Ably API keys <a id="api-keys"/>

Every Ably app can have one or more API keys associated with it. API keys authenticate directly with Ably or issue tokens. Keys can have different [capabilities](/docs/auth/capabilities), and tokens issued from a key can only have a subset of those capabilities.

### API key format <a id="format"/>

An Ably API key string has the following format: `I2E_JQ.OqUdfg:EVKVTCBlzLBPYJiCZTsIW_pqylJ9WVRB5K9P19Ap1y0`

The API key has three parts:

1. `I2E_JQ` - the public app ID
2. `OqUdfg` - the public key ID (`I2E_JQ.OqUdfg` together form the public API key ID)
3. `EVKVTCBlzLBPYJiCZTsIW_pqylJ9WVRB5K9P19Ap1y0` - the API key secret (never share this)

### Create an API key <a id="create"/>

API keys are created in the [Ably dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard) or programmatically via the [Control API](/docs/platform/account/control-api).

To create an API key in the dashboard:

1. Click the **API Keys** tab in your [dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard).
2. Click **Create a new API key**.
3. Enter a name to identify the key.
4. Select the [capabilities](/docs/auth/capabilities) to apply.
5. Optionally enable [token revocation](/docs/auth/revocation).
6. Optionally restrict scope to specific channels or queues.

<Aside data-type="note">
Code samples in this documentation use basic authentication for convenience. In production, never use basic authentication client-side as it exposes your API key.
</Aside>

## Selecting an authentication mechanism <a id="selecting-auth"/>

Ably supports two authentication mechanisms:

1. **[Token authentication](/docs/auth/token)**: Short-lived Ably Tokens that expire and can be revoked. Recommended for clients. Use [JWTs](/docs/auth/jwt) for most applications, or native [Ably Tokens](/docs/auth/ably-tokens) when JWTs aren't suitable.
2. **[Basic authentication](/docs/auth/basic)**: Uses your API key directly. Use only on trusted servers.

When deciding which method to use, apply the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege): a client should only possess the credentials and rights it needs. If credentials are compromised, the damage is minimized.

Many applications use a mixed strategy: trusted servers use basic authentication to issue tokens, while browsers and devices use those tokens.

| Scenario | Basic | Token | Recommendation |
|----------|:-----:|:-----:|----------------|
| Script may be exposed (browser, mobile) | No | Yes | Use token auth. Don't embed API keys in client code |
| No server to control access | Yes | No | Basic auth is your only option |
| Fine-grained access control needed | No | Yes | Token auth allows per-user [capabilities](/docs/auth/capabilities) |
| Time-limited or revocable access | No | Yes | Tokens expire and can be [revoked](/docs/auth/revocation) |
| Users must be identified | Yes* | Yes | With Basic auth, clients assert their own identity (must be trusted). With Token auth, the token issuer asserts identity (client need not be trusted). See [identified clients](/docs/auth/identified-clients). |
