# How-to: publish and subscribe to channels

Interactive how-tos let you get hands on with Ably features without needing to run or install anything locally.

This how-to steps through the basics of publishing and subscribing to Ably channels using the example of sports scores. You will publish basketball and football scores on a loop and subscribe two different clients to the results in realtime.

## What is pub/sub?

Publish-subscribe (pub/sub) is an architectural pattern that enables any number of publishers to send messages to a channel, and any number of channel subscribers to receive them. Publishers and subscribers are entirely decoupled from one another.

## What are channels?

Channels are used to organize messages into different topics. They are flexible building blocks that are used to represent 1:1 communication, a whole company group chat, sports match scores or an interactive whiteboard in an e-learning application.

## Files

The following files are used:

- `basketballPublisher.js` imitates a server publishing basketball scores.
- `basketballSubscriber.js` creates a client subscribing to basketball scores.
- `basketballGame.js` contains the basketball scores simulation logic.
- `footballPublisher.js` imitates a server publishing football scores to two different football leagues.
- `footballSubscriber.js` creates a client that can choose to subscribe to scores for each football league.
- `footballGame.js` contains the football scores simulation logic.

The server and clients are authenticated using basic authentication and a demo API key.

## Step 1: publish messages

The server does not need to subscribe to the scores, so it uses the REST interface to publish them.

In a real world scenario scores will be published as they happen by calling `publish()` as a point or goal is scored, or when a match finishes. To imitate a real world scenario, scores are published on a loop.

Copy the following function to L17 of `basketballPublisher.js` to publish the sports scores:

```javascript
await basketballChannel.publish('scoreUpdate', payload);
```

## Step 2: subscribe to channels

The clients are subscribed in realtime to the scoreboard channels, so they use the realtime interface to receive updates. Subscribing to a channel registers a listener which is called each time a message is received.

Click the **Subscribe** button on the basketball scoreboard to subscribe a client to basketball scores.

The football scores are published using two different message names to differentiate between the green and blue leagues.

Add the following parameters to `footballChannel.subscribe()` on L22 of `footballSubscriber.js`: `footballLeague`, `message`.

`footballLeague` ensures a listener is registered for the correct league when a client subscribes to it. In comparison, the basketball subscriber on L16 of `basketballSubscriber.js` subscribes to all events using `basketballChannel.subscribe((message))` because there are no leagues it needs to differentiate between.

L22 of `footballSubscriber.js` should now look like the following:

```javascript
footballChannel.subscribe(footballLeague, (message) => {
```

Use the football **Subscribe** buttons to choose which league, or leagues, each client subscribes to.

### Unsubscribe from a channel

Click the **Unsubscribe** button to unsubscribe a client from that sport. They stop receiving score updates for that sport once they are unsubscribed. This uses the `unsubscribe()` method.

<button onClick={props.showSolution} className="ui-button-primary">
  Show solution
</button>
