# Ably Pusher protocol adapter

**For a step-by-step tutorial to using the Pubnub protocol adapter, see https://www.ably.io/tutorials/pubnub-adapter**

Note: You need enable Pusher adapter support in your account dashboard before you can use the Pusher protocol adapter. See step 3 of [the tutorial](https://www.ably.io/tutorials/pubnub-adapter).

To use the Ably Pusher protocol adapter, you must initialize your Pusher client library as follows, assuming an [Ably API key](https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000030054-what-is-an-app-api-key) of `'appid.keyid:keysecret'`:

```js
var pusher = new Pusher('appid.keyid', {
  wsHost       : 'realtime-pusher.ably.io',
  httpHost     : 'realtime-pusher.ably.io',
  disableStats : true,
  encrypted    : true
});
```

And your Pusher REST libraries as (using ruby as an example):

```ruby
Pusher::Client.new(
  app_id:    'appid',
  key:       'appid.keyid',
  secret:    'keysecret',
  host:      'rest-pusher.ably.io',
  encrypted: true
)
```

Please note:

* For simplicity, the above example uses the Pusher Javascript and Ruby libraries. All other Pusher client libraries can be instanced in a similar fashion. See the [complete list of Pusher client libraries and their documentation](https://pusher.com/docs/libraries).
* For the Pusher key, use the part of the [Ably API key](https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000030054-what-is-an-app-api-key) before the colon; for the secret, use the part after the colon.
* You can add any other Pusher options you would normally use in the initializer.
* In the Pusher client library terminology, the 'encrypted' option controls whether the the lib uses TLS, not end-to-end encryption. Setting the `encrypted` option to true is not mandatory, but strongly recommended to avoid sending private keys over plain text connections.
* Pusher adapter clients are not "identified" in the Ably sense. Make sure you do not have 'require identification' channel rule on for any channels/namespaces you will be accessing with the adapter. See [this article](https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030057-what-are-channel-rules-and-how-can-i-use-them-in-my-app-) on how to change channel rules. If you get an "Ably error 40160", this is the reason why.
* *The Pusher channel will have a different name from the corresponding Ably channel*. See the 'Channels' section below.

## Usage notes

### General

- While the Pusher adapter is quite a light translation layer (certainly a good deal lighter than the Pubnub adapter), a protocol adapter inevitably adds some latency. Using the adapter will be a little slower than using Ably native client libraries. Typically the impact is in the low milliseconds. By the same token, it will likely also be marginally slower than using Pusher natively -- but only if you are close to whichever Pusher data-center you are using. If not, the extra milliseconds of latency from the adapter should be more than compensated for by being able to use a data-center closer to you (unlike Pusher, Ably has data-centers in [9+ regions worldwide](https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000029525-where-are-ably-s-servers-located-around-the-world) and federates messages between them - you automatically connect to the closest one to you, using latency-based routing).
- Behind the scenes, the adapter just uses the normal Ably service, so there is no problem with using Pusher and Ably client libraries side by side (though bear in mind channel name translation, see below). You can mix and match as you like; for example, using Pusher client libraries normally, but using the Ably REST api to get channel history, which is not available through the Pusher clients.
- While using the adapter gives you some of the advantages of Ably over Pusher (eg inter-region message federation), many others (e.g. [continuity guarantees](https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000044639-connection-state-recovery), [fallback host support](https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000044636-routing-around-network-and-dns-issues), [history](https://www.ably.io/documentation/realtime/history), [flexible channel namespaces](https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000030058-what-is-a-channel-namespace-and-how-can-i-use-them-), [powerful token authentication](https://www.ably.io/documentation/general/authentication)) require the use of the Ably client libraries. As a result, if a native Ably library is available for your platform, we recommend you consider using the Ably client libraries instead or at least make a plan to eventually transition over to Ably native client libraries.

### Security

When using Ably normally, you cannot connect to the Ably service at all without a complete API key, or a token derived from one. When using the Pusher adapter, you can connect to public channels (see 'Channels' below) with only the Ably key name (the app id together with the key id). Since the Pusher adapter lets you do something that would not normally be possible with Ably, it needs to be explicitly enabled for each api key you want to use it with. You can do this on your account dashboard, in the settings tab for each app you want to use with the adapter.

### Channels

- Ably and Pusher both have various (incompatible) restrictions on channel names, and use namespaces very differently. So when using the adapter, channel names are mapped. That is, if you connect to the channel "foo" using the Pusher adapter, it will actually use the Ably channel "public:foo". The channel name translation rules are as follows:
 - Pusher public channels (no prefix) are mapped to the the Ably 'public:' namespace.
 - Pusher private channels ('private-' prefix) are mapped to the the Ably 'private:' namespace.
 - Pusher presence channels ('presence-' prefix) are mapped to the the Ably 'presence:' namespace.
 - Conversely, Ably channels not in any of the 'public:', 'private:', or 'presence:' namespaces get a 'private-ablyroot-' prefix.
 - Colons are banned in Pusher channel names, but are important in Ably channel names, as they act as the namespace separator. So the adaptor maps semicolons to colons: semicolons in Pusher channel names become colons in Ably channel names, and vice versa. (This means you will not be able to access any Ably channels which have semicolons in their name).

A few examples:

Pusher adapter channel    | Actual Ably channel
--------------------------|-------------
presence-foo              |  presence:foo
private-foo               |  private:foo
foo                       |  public:foo
foo;bar                   |  public:foo:bar
private-ablyroot-foo      |  foo
private-ablyroot-foo;bar  |  foo:bar

### User and subscriber count

Getting total subscriber count for a channel is a planned feature in Ably. For now, 'subscriber count', like 'user count', will only work with presence channels. 'User count' gives the size of the presence set once uniqified by [`clientId`](https://www.ably.io/documentation/realtime/authentication#identified-clients), and 'subscriber count' gives the raw size of the presence set.
