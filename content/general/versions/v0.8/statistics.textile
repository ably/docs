title: Application Statistics
section: general

The Ably system can be queried to obtain usage statistics for a given application, and results are provided aggregated across all channels in use in the application in the specified period. Stats may be used to track usage against account quotas.  The details on how to retrieve statistics are available in the "REST API documentation":/rest-api#stats, "Realtime client library statistics documentation":/realtime/statistics and "REST client library statistics documentation":/rest/statistics.

Statistics returned from the API are sparse; this means that if a metric object such as a message count @{ count: [val], data: val }@ is empty or contains only zero values for all key value pairs, then the metric will be omitted completely from the JSON response.  This reduces the size of the JSON significantly and thus improves performance.
