# Error 93002: Mutable Messages feature required

## What Happened

The operation you're attempting requires the Mutable Messages feature to be enabled for this channel's namespace, but it's not currently activated.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 93002 | 400 | Channel Error (Feature Gate) | No - requires feature enablement |

## Quick Fix

- Verify the Mutable Messages feature is enabled for your account
- Check you're using the correct app with the feature enabled
- Contact Ably support at https://ably.com/support to enable this feature

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Annotation-subscribe mode is only supported on channels with Mutable Messages enabled in channel namespace settings"
- "Can only publish annotations to channels in a namespace with the Mutable Messages feature enabled"

## Common Causes

1. **Feature not enabled at namespace level** (80% of cases)
   - Mutable Messages feature not activated for your account
   - Using an app that doesn't have the feature enabled in its namespace
   - Feature not configured for the specific namespace you're using
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93002-analysis.md lines 29-33 -->

2. **Using annotation operations without feature** (15% of cases)
   - Attempting to subscribe to message annotations (`ANNOTATION_SUBSCRIBE` mode)
   - Publishing messages with annotations
   - Using message editing or reaction capabilities
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93002-analysis.md lines 35-37 -->

3. **Environment configuration mismatch** (5% of cases)
   - Development environment has feature enabled, production doesn't
   - Using incorrect app credentials for the environment
   - Migration from non-mutable to mutable namespace incomplete
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93002-knowledge.md lines 44-48 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify feature availability**
   - Check your Ably dashboard for available features
   - Confirm your account plan includes Mutable Messages
   - Verify which apps and namespaces have the feature enabled
   - Test with a simple annotation operation to confirm status
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93002-knowledge.md lines 24-29, lines 136-140 -->

2. **Enable the feature**
   - Contact Ably support at https://ably.com/support
   - Specify which apps and namespaces need the Mutable Messages feature
   - Provide your account ID, app ID, and use case requirements
   - Test in staging environment first before production enablement
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93002-knowledge.md lines 57-61 -->

3. **Use the correct app and namespace**
   - Ensure you're using API keys from an app with the feature enabled
   - Verify the channel namespace has Mutable Messages activated
   - Double-check environment variables and configuration
   - Confirm namespace settings match your requirements
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93002-analysis.md lines 65-68 -->

4. **Alternative approaches if feature unavailable**
   - Use separate channels for metadata instead of annotations
   - Implement application-level annotation logic
   - Store annotations in an external database
   - Use standard message metadata fields for additional data
   - Consider message history with external tracking for edits
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93002-knowledge.md lines 31-36 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a feature availability error that will not be automatically retried. The Mutable Messages feature must be enabled at the namespace level before operations requiring it will succeed. SDKs will not attempt to retry this error as it indicates a configuration requirement rather than a transient issue.
<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93002-analysis.md lines 29-33 -->

## Prevention

- Document which features your application requires during development
- Test feature availability in development environments first
- Plan for graceful degradation if the feature is unavailable
- Consider fallback strategies for environments without the feature
- Check namespace configuration before attempting annotation operations
- Implement feature detection in your application initialization
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/93002-knowledge.md lines 49-54 -->

## What Requires Mutable Messages

The following operations require the Mutable Messages feature:
- Annotation subscriptions on channels
- Publishing messages with annotations
- Message editing capabilities
- Message reaction features
- Any operation that modifies message content after publishing
