# Error 20000: Informational status

## What Happened

The Ably protocol requires an ErrorInfo object for certain operations, even when nothing is wrong—this is that informational status.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 20000 | 200/204 | Protocol Information | N/A - not an actual error |

## Quick Fix

- **No action required** - This is normal protocol behavior
- Check the message text to understand what operation completed
- Continue normal operations

## Error Messages

You may see one of these informational messages:
- "Transport superseded" (most common - 60% of cases)
- "Transport superseded as active transport"
- "Connection superseded"
- "Client no longer needed, resource being disposed"
- "Coordinator idle (no existing coordinator and create-on-request disabled)"
- "Declining token as not active"
- "Unable to hand token off to successor"
- "Transient attachment detaching"

## Common Causes

This isn't an error but appears in these normal scenarios:

1. **Connection upgrades** (60% of occurrences)
   - WebSocket connection replacing an older connection
   - Multiple browser tabs or iframes connecting to same channel
   - Transport protocol switching (WebSocket to HTTP or vice versa)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/20000-analysis.md lines 86-95 -->

2. **Resource cleanup** (20% of occurrences)
   - Unused connections being closed
   - Idle coordinators shutting down
   - Global resources being disposed
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/20000-analysis.md lines 96-101 -->

3. **Channel management** (20% of occurrences)
   - Channel relocations on backend
   - Inactive channels declining lifecycle tokens
   - Channel attachment state changes
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/20000-analysis.md lines 103-109 -->

## Why You're Seeing This

Error 20000 appears in logs during normal Ably operations. The protocol specification requires an ErrorInfo object for certain state transitions and cleanup operations, even when everything is working correctly. Think of it as an "FYI" status rather than an error.
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/20000-knowledge.md lines 6-8 -->

Common situations where you'll see this:
- Opening your app in multiple browser tabs
- Recovering from temporary network disconnections
- Normal connection lifecycle during long-running sessions
- Backend load balancing operations

## Resolution Steps

Since this isn't an actual error, no resolution is needed. However, if you're concerned:

1. **Verify your app is working normally**
   - Check that messages are being sent and received
   - Confirm presence updates are working
   - Ensure no actual connectivity issues exist

2. **Check the specific message text**
   - "Transport superseded" means a newer connection replaced an older one (normal)
   - "Resource being disposed" means cleanup of unused resources (normal)
   - "Coordinator idle" means the coordinator entered standby mode (normal)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/20000-analysis.md lines 17-45 -->

3. **Monitor for actual issues**
   - Look for error codes in the 40xxx, 50xxx, or 80xxx ranges
   - Check for connection state changes to `failed` or `suspended`
   - Watch for message delivery failures

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs handle all scenarios that generate error 20000 automatically. The SDK:
- Manages connection upgrades transparently
- Cleans up resources as needed
- Handles channel relocations seamlessly
- Maintains message delivery throughout these operations

## Prevention

You cannot and should not try to prevent error 20000—it's a normal part of Ably's operation. If you want to reduce log noise:

- Consider filtering out error 20000 from your error monitoring
- Log it at INFO or DEBUG level rather than ERROR
- Focus monitoring on actual error codes that require attention

## Related Errors

• **[80000 - Connection Failed](https://help.ably.io/error/80000)**  
  Actual connection failures that require attention, unlike error 20000

• **[80014 - Connection Timeout](https://help.ably.io/error/80014)**  
  Real timeout issues that indicate connection problems

• **[90000 - Channel Operation Failed](https://help.ably.io/error/90000)**  
  Channel failures that need resolution, unlike normal channel lifecycle events in 20000

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Clear explanation in main error codes documentation that 20000 is informational only
- Impact: Causes customer confusion and support tickets as seen in HubSpot ticket #1259163022
- Recommendation: Update https://github.com/ably/ably-common/blob/main/protocol/errors.json to include error 20000
- Severity: Medium - generates unnecessary support burden
