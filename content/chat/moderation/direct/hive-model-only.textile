"Hive Moderation":https://hivemoderation.com is a powerful suite of moderation tools that can be used to moderate content in chat rooms.

The Hive (Model Only) rule is a rule applied to chat rooms in Ably Chat which enables you to use Hive's text moderation models to detect and handle inappropriate content before it is published to other users.

h2(#fields). Rule fields

- Hive API key := The API key for your Hive account.
- Thresholds := A map of text "text moderation classes":https://docs.thehive.ai/reference/text-moderation to "severity":https://docs.thehive.ai/docs/detailed-class-descriptions-text-moderation. When moderating text, any message deemed to be at or above a specified threshold will be rejected and not published to the chat room.
- Model URL (optional) := A custom URL if using a custom moderation model.
- Retry timeout := Maximum duration (in milliseconds) that an attempt to invoke the rule may take (including any retries). The possible range is 0 - 5000ms.
- Max retries := Maximum number of retries after the first attempt at invoking the rule.
- Failed action := The action to take in the event that a rule fails to invoke. Options are reject the request or publish anyway.
- Too many requests action := The action to take in the event that Hive returns a 429 (Too Many Requests Response). Options are to fail rule invocation, or retry.
- Room filter (optional) := A regular expression to match to specific chat rooms.

h2(#text-length). Text length

Hive's models accept content with a maximum length of 1024 characters. If sending a message larger than this, Ably will automatically break the text into smaller requests, with crossover between segments to ensure context is preserved.

Ably will aggregate the model responses, rejecting the message as a whole if one or more of the text segments fail to pass the threshold requirements.

h2(#rejections). Handling rejections

If a message fails moderation and the rule policy is to reject, then it will be rejected by the server.

Moderation rejections will use error code @42213@.
