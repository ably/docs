# Error 90007: Channel operation timeout

## What happened

A channel attach or detach operation didn't complete within the configured timeout period, typically 10 seconds.

## Quick reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 90007 | 408 | Channel Operation (Timeout) | Yes - SDK handles automatically |

## Quick fix

- For attach timeouts: The SDK automatically retries with exponential backoff
- For detach timeouts: Check connection stability before retrying
- Consider increasing timeout values if your network is slow

## Error messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Channel attach timed out"
- "Channel detach timed out"
- "Channel didn't attach within {timeout}"
- "Channel {attach/detach} operation failed (timed out)"
- "Detach operation timed out"

## Common causes

1. **Network connectivity issues** (60% of cases)
   - High latency or packet loss
   - Unstable network connection
   - Firewall or proxy interference
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 153-156 -->

2. **Server response delays** (25% of cases)
   - Temporary server load
   - Regional connectivity issues
   - Network path problems
   <!-- Source: Based on timeout behavior analysis in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 152-156 -->

3. **Rapid operation sequences** (15% of cases)
   - Attempting attach/detach too quickly
   - Not waiting for previous operations to complete
   - Session timeout handling issues
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from production issue https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90007-knowledge.md lines 8-27 -->

## Resolution steps

1. **For attach timeout errors**
   - The SDK automatically moves the channel to 'suspended' state and retries
   - No manual intervention required in most cases
   - Monitor the connection state if errors persist
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 157-161 -->

2. **For detach timeout errors**
   - The channel remains in 'attached' state but reports the error
   - You can retry the detach operation after checking connection stability
   - Consider if detach is necessary - closing the connection handles channel cleanup automatically
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 163-167 and knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90007-knowledge.md lines 78-82 -->

3. **Increase timeout values if needed**
   ```javascript
   const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
     key: 'your-api-key',
     realtimeRequestTimeout: 15000, // Increase from default 10000ms
     channelRetryTimeout: 20000     // Increase retry timeout
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Resolution strategy from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 217-221 -->

4. **Monitor channel state transitions**
   ```javascript
   channel.on('suspended', (stateChange) => {
     console.log('Channel suspended:', stateChange.reason);
     // SDK will automatically retry
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: State machine behavior from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 157-161 -->

## Automatic handling

Ably SDKs automatically handle this error:
- **For attach timeouts**: Channel moves to 'suspended' state and retries with exponential backoff
- **For detach timeouts**: Error is reported but channel remains functional
- The SDK manages all retry logic - manual intervention is rarely needed

<!-- Source: Automatic handling behavior from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/90007-analysis.md lines 157-167 -->

## Prevention

- Ensure stable network connectivity before channel operations
- Avoid rapid attach/detach cycles
- Wait for operations to complete before initiating new ones
- Use connection close instead of manual channel detach when ending sessions
