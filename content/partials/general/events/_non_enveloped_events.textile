h4(#no-envelope-example-message). Non-enveloped message events

For @message@ events, there will be the additional headers:

- x-ably-message-name := The "name":/realtime/messages#name of the @Message@

The payload will contain the "data":/realtime/messages#data of the @Message@.

For example, if you sent the following curl message, which sends a JSON message to the channel @my_channel@:

```[curl]
curl -X POST https://rest.ably.io/channels/my_channel/messages \
          -u "{{API_KEY}}" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data '{ "name": "publish", "data": "example" }'
```

The @x-ably-message-name@ header would be @publish@, and the payload would be @example@.

h4(#no-envelope-example-presence). Non-enveloped presence events

For @Presence@ events, there will be the additional headers:

- x-ably-message-action := the action performed by the event (@update@, @enter@, @leave@)

The payload will contain the "data":/realtime/presence#presence-message of the @Presence@ message.

For example, if a "client enters":/realtime/presence#enter a channel's presence with the following code:

```[jsall]
realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: '{{API_KEY}}', clientId: 'bob' });
channel = realtime.channels.get('some_channel');
channel.presence.enter('some data');
```

Then the @x-ably-message-action@ would be @enter@, the @x-ably-message-client-id@ would be "bob", and the payload would be "some data".
