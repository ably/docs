Manage who has access to your Ably account and what they can do. Invite users, assign roles, and configure team-based access for Enterprise accounts.

Manage users through your [account dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/users).

## User roles <a id="roles"/>

The user that creates an Ably account is assigned the account owner role. An account can only have a single account owner. Users can be assigned multiple roles:

- Developer
- Billing
- Admin
- Owner

## Enterprise team management <a id="enterprise"/>

<Aside data-type='note'>
An [Enterprise](/docs/platform/pricing/enterprise) account is required to use team management features. [Contact us](https://ably.com/support) to enable team for your account.
</Aside>

Team allows you to manage multiple Ably accounts by centralizing user access and roles under a single team structure. Configure user provisioning through [Single Sign-On (SSO)](/docs/platform/account/sso) and SCIM for group-based access control.

Access your [team settings](https://ably.com/accounts/any/organization) to manage your team configuration.

### Primary account <a id="primary"/>

The primary account is a team's main account and holds the following privileges:

- The highest level of access to the team.
- Ownership of all accounts within the team.
- The default account used for provisioning.

### Create accounts in a team <a id="accounts"/>

1. Open the "Account" navigation dropdown.
2. Click "Team Accounts".
3. Click "New account".
4. Add an account name and click "Create account".

You can separate accounts within a team to create isolated environments, such as production, staging, and development. Assign each environment a [package](/docs/pricing#packages) that meets its specific needs.

### Provision users via SCIM <a id="scim"/>

<Aside data-type='note'>
Google Workspace *alone* does not natively support SCIM.
</Aside>

Manage access to multiple Ably accounts through a single identity provider. Configure both [SSO](/docs/platform/account/sso) and SCIM. Once configured, Ably automatically provisions and deprovisions users. New users are added to the default provisioning account with the "Developer" role.

Ably only recognizes one registered email domain per team. Unrecognized email domains will be rejected.

Users provisioned through SCIM cannot modify their name or email address within Ably. Updates must be made through your identity provider.

Provision users through SCIM:

1. Configure [SSO](/docs/platform/account/sso) between Ably and your identity provider.
2. Copy Ably SCIM configuration values:
   1. Open the "Account" navigation dropdown in the Ably dashboard.
   2. Select "Team Settings" from the menu.
   3. Navigate to the "Users & Groups Provisioning (SCIM)" section and copy the Service Provider Configuration Endpoint, SCIM Username, and SCIM Password.
3. In your identity provider's provisioning app, paste the Service Provider Configuration Endpoint, SCIM Username, and SCIM Password values from Ably.
4. Complete any additional setup required by your identity provider.

### Manage team roles <a id="manage"/>

Manage user and group roles across accounts within your team. Use the "Team Users" page as a central point of control, rather than managing access individually within each account.

<Aside data-type='note'>
When modifying an individual user's roles, any rights assigned via groups will be greyed out and cannot be changed directly.
</Aside>

#### Group roles <a id="group"/>

When team and your identity provider are configured, the groups you create in the identity provider are synchronized with Ably. Assign roles to groups and all users in a group inherit those roles.

Manage group roles:

1. Open the "Account" navigation dropdown.
2. Click "Team Users".
3. Under "Ably Realtime identity provider groups", click "Manage account access".
4. Select the group whose access you want to manage.
5. Specify the required "Roles" for the group.

## Delete your profile or leave an account <a id="leave"/>

1. Log in to your [account](https://ably.com/accounts/any).
2. Go to [My Settings](https://ably.com/users/edit).
3. [Disconnect SSO provider](#sso) if you use SSO to log in.
4. Scroll to "Want to delete your profile?"
5. Click "Start" to remove yourself from this account.

<Aside data-type='important'>
Account owners: Deleting your profile will delete the entire account and all data. You must first [transfer ownership](https://faqs.ably.com/can-i-change-my-ably-account-owner) to another user before deleting your profile.
</Aside>

## Close your account <a id="close"/>

You must be the account owner and have downgraded to the Free package:

1. Log in to your [Ably account](https://ably.com/accounts/any).
2. Ensure you are the [account owner](#roles).
3. [Downgrade your current package](/docs/platform/pricing/free#downgrade) to Free.

<Aside data-type='note'>
You will not be able to delete your account until the 1st of the month following your downgrade, after your final invoice has been paid.
</Aside>

4. [Disconnect SSO provider](#sso) if you use SSO to log in.
5. Go to your [My Settings](https://ably.com/users/edit) page.
6. Scroll to "Want to delete your profile?"

<Aside data-type='note'>
If you use an SSO login you'll see a "Contact us" link instead of a "Start" button. [Disconnect your SSO provider](#sso) first.
</Aside>

7. Click "Start" to proceed with closing your account.
8. Review the accounts for closure.
9. Click "Close Account" to permanently deactivate your account.

### Disconnect SSO provider <a id="sso"/>

If you use SSO to log in, you must set a password and disconnect your SSO provider before closing your account:

1. Log in to your [account](https://ably.com/accounts/any) using your current SSO method (Google or GitHub).
2. Navigate to Account then [My Settings](https://ably.com/users/edit).
3. In the Password section, click "Change your password".
4. Click "Update my personal settings" to save the changes.
5. Scroll to the Login provider section.
6. Click "remove connection" next to the SSO provider you want to disconnect.
