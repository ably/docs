Documentation is the bedrock of understanding and using software, especially for such complicated and essential functionality as realtime messaging. Nowadays this is a really low bar but far too many services still have minimal, incomplete, or no documentation at all. Clear and succinct documentation is usually a good indication that the service is well-designed and you’ll be able to find the information you need. And if they’re using the "OpenAPI Specification":https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification then that’s a good sign too.
