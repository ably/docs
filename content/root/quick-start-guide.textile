Welcome to Ably. This guide shows you how to integrate Ably's realtime platform into an application.

You'll learn how to:

* Include an Ably Client Library SDK in a project.
* Establish a realtime connection to Ably.
* Subscribe to a channel to receive messages.
* Publish a message on a channel.
* Close a connection to Ably.

p(tip#terms). The terms used in the guide such as 'connection', 'channel', 'message', 'publish' and 'subscribe' are described in the "glossary":/glossary.

Ably Client Library SDKs are available in multiple programming languages. Some SDKs have a realtime and a REST interface, while others only have a REST interface. The "SDK downloads":https://ably.com/download page lists availability. For further information on when it's best to use the realtime or REST SDK, see "the best practice guide":https://ably.com/docs/best-practice-guide#choosing-between-realtime-rest-mqtt.

blang[jsall].
  bq. **Note:** The JavaScript and Node.js code snippets in this Quickstart guide do not show the main @async@ wrapper function. However, the complete source code for the JavaScript and Node.js code snippets can be found in the "Quickstart repo":https://github.com/ably/quickstart-js. Both callback and promises interface examples are provided.

h2(#step-0). Create an Ably account

"Sign up":https://ably.com/signup for a free account to get your own API key.

The following code sample uses a demo API key to authenticate. Alternatively, you can use your Ably API key if you have an Ably account. Ensure that your Ably API key includes the subscribe and publish "capabilities":/core-features/authentication#capabilities-explained.

h2(#step-1). Add the Ably Client Library SDK

blang[javascript].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available via CDN.

  To get started with your project, add the SDK into your @build.gradle@ dependencies section and a reference to Maven in the repositories section if it isn't included by default.

  For Java applications:

  ```[java]
  dependencies {
    implementation 'io.ably:ably-java:1.2.0'
  }

  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  ```

  For Android apps:

  ```[java]
  dependencies {
    implementation 'io.ably:ably-android:1.2.0'
  }

  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  ```

  *Note*: In the above examples a specific version of the SDK is referenced. Ably recommends that you always use the latest stable version available for "Java":https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ably/ably-java/latest and "Android":https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ably/ably-android/latest.

  Ensure the SDK is included in your classpath using:

  ```[java]
  import io.ably.lib.types.*;
  import io.ably.lib.realtime.*;
  ```

blang[objc].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available as a CocoaPod.

  ```

blang[csharp].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is hosted on "GitHub":https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet and is also available as a "Nuget package":https://www.nuget.org/packages/ably.io/.

  To get started with your project, install the package into your project directory using the .NET CLI:

  ```[sh]
  dotnet add package ably.io --version [version]
  ```

  Or install the SDK from the Package Manager Console:

  ```[text]
  PM> Install-Package ably.io
  ```

  Then add the SDK to your @.cs@ file:

  ```[csharp]
  using IO.Ably;
  using IO.Ably.Realtime;
  ```

blang[flutter].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is hosted on "GitHub":https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter and available as a "Flutter plugin":https://pub.dev/packages/ably_flutter.

  To get started with your project, update your @pubspec.yaml@ with the package and version:

  ```[yaml]
  dependencies:
    # ...
    ably_flutter: [version]
    # ...
  ```

  Import the package into your Dart file:

  ```[flutter]
  import 'package:ably_flutter/ably_flutter.dart' as ably;
  ```

blang[go].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is hosted on "Github":https://github.com/ably/ably-go and can be installed by running the @go get@ command:

  ```[go]
  go get -u github.com/ably/ably-go/ably
  ```

  Import the packages into your Go file:

  bc[go]. import (
      "context"
      "fmt"
      "github.com/ably/ably-go/ably"
  )

h2(#step-2). Connect to Ably

blang[default].
  Clients need to authenticate with Ably to establish a realtime connection, typically over "WebSockets":https://ably.com/topic/websockets. The following code sample prints the message @Connected to Ably!@ when you've successfully connected.

blang[python,php].
  The <span lang="python">Python</span><span lang="php">PHP</span> SDK is only available with a REST interface. You will need to use one of the realtime libraries to create a realtime connection to Ably. Use the language selector above to select a language with realtime support.

*Note*: The connection example uses basic authentication to pass the API key from the application to Ably. Basic authentication should not be used client-side in a production environment, such as in a browser, to avoid exposing the API key. "Token authentication":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication should be used instead.

bc[javascript]. // For the full code sample see here: https://github.com/ably/quickstart-js
const ably = new Ably.Realtime.Promise('{{API_KEY}}');
await ably.connection.once('connected');
console.log('Connected to Ably!');

bc[nodejs]. // For the full code sample see here: https://github.com/ably/quickstart-js
const ably = new Ably.Realtime.Promise('{{API_KEY}}');
await ably.connection.once('connected');
console.log('Connected to Ably!');

bc[java]. ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions("{{API_KEY}}");
AblyRealtime ably = new AblyRealtime(options);
ably.connection.on(ConnectionState.connected, new ConnectionStateListener() {
  @Override
  public void onConnectionStateChanged(ConnectionStateChange state) {
    System.out.println("New state is " + state.current.name());
    switch (state.current) {
      case connected: {
        // Successful connection
        System.out.println("Connected to Ably!");
        break;
      }
      case failed: {
        // Failed connection
        break;
      }
    }
  }
});

bc[ruby]. EventMachine.run do
  ably = Ably::Realtime.new(key: '{{API_KEY}}')
  ably.connection.on(:connected) do
    puts "Connected to Ably!"
  end
end

bc[swift]. let ably = ARTRealtime(key: "{{API_KEY}}")
ably.connection.on { stateChange in
    let stateChange = stateChange
    switch stateChange.current {
    case .connected:
        print("Connected to Ably!")
    case .failed:
        print("Failed to connect to Ably.")
    default:
        break
    }
}

bc[csharp]. var ably = new AblyRealtime("{{API_KEY}}");
ably.Connection.On(ConnectionEvent.Connected, args =>
{
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Connected to Ably!");
});

bc[objc]. ARTRealtime *ably = [[ARTRealtime alloc] initWithKey:@"{{API_KEY}}"];
[ably.connection on:ARTRealtimeConnectionEventConnected callback:^(ARTConnectionStateChange *stateChange) {
    NSLog(@"Connected to Ably!");
}];

bc[flutter]. final clientOptions = ably.ClientOptions.fromKey('{{API_KEY}}');
final realtime = ably.Realtime(options: clientOptions);
realtime.connection
  .on(ably.ConnectionEvent.connected)
  .listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
    print('New state is: ${stateChange.current}');
    switch (stateChange.current) {
      case ably.ConnectionState.connected:
        // Successful connection
        print('Connected to Ably!');
        break;
      case ably.ConnectionState.failed:
        // Failed connection
        break;
    }
});

bc[go]. // Instantiate the Ably client. Calling ably.WithAutoConnect(false) is optional
// but ensures that you don't miss state changes.
client, err := ably.NewRealtime(ably.WithKey("{{API_KEY}}"), ably.WithAutoConnect(false))
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
client.Connection.OnAll(func(change ably.ConnectionStateChange) {
    fmt.Printf("Connection event: %s state=%s reason=%s\n", change.Event, change.Current, change.Reason)
})
client.Connect()

h2(#step-3). Subscribe to a channel

blang[default].
  Messages are broadcast on channels. The following example code subscribes the client to a channel called @quickstart@ and sets a filter so that the client only receives messages with the name @greeting@. When a message is received, its contents will be printed after the text @Received a greeting message in realtime:@.

  *Note*: The channel is created in the Ably service when the client subscribes to it.

blang[python,php].
  The <span lang="python">Python</span><span lang="php">PHP</span> SDK is only available with a REST interface. You will need to use one of the realtime libraries to subscribe to a channel and receive messages. Use the language selector above to select a language with realtime support.

```[javascript]
// get the channel to subscribe to
const channel = ably.channels.get('quickstart');

/* 
  Subscribe to a channel. 
  The promise resolves when the channel is attached 
  (and resolves synchronously if the channel is already attached).
*/
await channel.subscribe('greeting', (message) => {
  console.log('Received a greeting message in realtime: ' + message.data)
});
```

```[nodejs]
// get the channel to subscribe to
const channel = ably.channels.get('quickstart');

/* 
  Subscribe to a channel. 
  The promise resolves when the channel is attached 
  (and resolves synchronously if the channel is already attached).
*/
await channel.subscribe('greeting', (message) => {
  console.log('Received a greeting message in realtime: ' + message.data)
});
```

```[ruby]
  channel = ably.channels.get('quickstart')
  channel.subscribe('greeting') do |message|
    puts "Received a greeting message in realtime: #{message.data}"
  end
```

```[java]
  Channel channel = ably.channels.get("quickstart");
  channel.subscribe("greeting", new Channel.MessageListener() {
    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
      System.out.println("Received a greeting message in realtime: " + message.data);
    }
  });
```

bc[swift]. let channel = ably.channels.get("quickstart")
channel.subscribe("greeting") { message in
    print("Received a greeting message in realtime:\(message.data as! String)")
}

bc[csharp]. var channel = ably.Channels.Get("quickstart");
channel.Subscribe(message =>
{
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Received a greeting message in realtime: {0}", message.Data);
});

bc[objc]. ARTRealtimeChannel *channel = [ably.channels get:@"quickstart"];
[channel subscribe:@"greeting" callback:^(ARTMessage *message) {
    NSLog(@"Received a greeting message in realtime: %@", message.data);
}];

bc[flutter]. final channel = realtime.channels.get('quickstart');
channel.subscribe().listen((message) {
      print('Received a greeting message in realtime: ${message.data}');
    }
  );

bc[go]. channel := client.Channels.Get("quickstart")
_, err = channel.Subscribe(context.Background(), "greeting", func(msg *ably.Message) {
    fmt.Printf("Received message : '%v'\n", msg.Data)
})
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

h2(#step-4). Publish a message

The following example code publishes a message to the @quickstart@ channel with the name @greeting@ and the contents @hello!@.

bc[jsall]. await channel.publish('greeting', 'hello!');

bc[java]. Channel channel = ably.channels.get("quickstart");
channel.publish("greeting", "hello", new CompletionListener() {
  @Override
  public void onSuccess() {
    System.out.println("Message sent");
  }
  @Override
  public void onError(ErrorInfo reason) {
    System.out.println("Message not sent, error occurred: " + reason.message);
  }
});

bc[csharp]. var channel = ably.Channels.Get("quickstart");
channel.Publish("greeting", "hello!");

bc[python]. async def main():
  ably = AblyRest('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = ably.channels.get('quickstart')
  await channel.publish(u'greeting', u'hello!')
  # other code such as publish, close
asyncio.run(main())

bc[ruby]. channel = ably.channels.get('quickstart')
channel.publish 'greeting', 'hello!'

bc[php]. $client = new Ably\AblyRest('{{API_KEY}}');
$channel = $client->channels->get('quickstart');
$channel->publish('greeting', 'hello!');

bc[swift]. let channel = ably.channels.get("quickstart")
channel.publish("greeting", data: "hello!")

bc[objc]. ARTRealtimeChannel *channel = [ably.channels get:@"quickstart"];
[channel publish:@"greeting" data:@"hello!"];

bc[flutter]. final channel = realtime.channels.get('quickstart');
await channel.publish(name: 'greeting', data: 'hello!');

bc[go]. channel := client.Channels.Get("quickstart")
err = channel.Publish(context.Background(), "greeting", "hello!")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

h3(#rest-api). Publish with the REST API

It's possible to interact directly with the "HTTP REST API":/rest-api even though the SDKs are the recommended way to develop and interact with Ably.

Copy the following @curl@ code sample into your terminal to publish a message and view the response in your browser.

bc[sh]. curl https://rest.ably.io/channels/{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}/publish \
  --user "{{API_KEY}}" \
  --data "name=greeting&data=Hello"

h2(#step-5). Close a connection to Ably

blang[default].
  A connection to Ably can be closed once it is no longer needed.

  The following code sample explicitly closes the connection to Ably and prints the message @Closed the connection to Ably.@.

blang[php].
  The <span lang="php">PHP</span> SDK is only available with a REST interface. You will need to use one of the realtime libraries to create or manage a connection to Ably. Use the language selector above to select a language with realtime support.

bc[javascript]. ably.close(); // runs synchronously
console.log('Closed the connection to Ably.');

bc[nodejs]. ably.close(); // runs synchronously
console.log('Closed the connection to Ably.');

bc[java]. ably.connection.close();
ably.connection.on(ConnectionState.closed, new ConnectionStateListener() {
  @Override
  public void onConnectionStateChanged(ConnectionStateChange state) {
    System.out.println("New state is " + state.current.name());
    switch (state.current) {
      case closed: {
        // Connection closed
        System.out.println("Closed the connection to Ably.");
        break;
      }
      case failed: {
        // Failed to close connection
        break;
      }
    }
  }
});

bc[python]. await ably.close()
print('Closed the connection to Ably.')

bc[ruby]. ably.connection.close
ably.connection.on(:closed) do
  puts "Closed the connection to Ably!"
end

bc[swift]. ably.connection.close()
ably.connection.on { stateChange in
    let stateChange = stateChange
    switch stateChange.current {
    case .closed:
        print("Closed the connection to Ably.")
    case .failed:
        print("Failed to close connection to Ably.")
    default:
        break
    }
}

bc[csharp]. ably.Connection.Close();
ably.Connection.On(ConnectionEvent.Closed, args =>
{
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Closed the connection to Ably.");
});

bc[objc]. [ably.connection close];
[ably.connection on:ARTRealtimeConnectionEventClosed callback:^(ARTConnectionStateChange *stateChange) {
    NSLog(@"Closed the connection to Ably.");
}];

bc[flutter]. realtime.connection.close();
realtime.connection
  .on(ably.ConnectionEvent.closed)
  .listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
    print('New state is: ${stateChange.current}');
    switch (stateChange.current) {
      case ably.ConnectionState.closed:
        // Connection closed
        print('Closed the connection to Ably.');
        break;
      case ably.ConnectionState.failed:
        // Failed to close connection
        break;
    }
});

bc[go]. client.Connection.On(ably.ConnectionEventClosed, func(change ably.ConnectionStateChange) {
    fmt.Println("Closed the connection to Ably.")
})
client.Close()
