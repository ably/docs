Error 40010 occurs when a channel name or qualifier doesn't meet Ably's validation requirements.

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40010 | 400 | Client Error (Channel) | No |

## Error messages

| Message | Context |
|---------|---------|
| `Invalid channel name` | General channel name validation failure |
| `Invalid qualifier in channelId` | Channel qualifier syntax error |
| `regex match failed` | Channel name pattern validation failure |
| `cannot use a derived option with a {type} channel` | Incompatible channel options |
| `unable to attach to channel; invalid channel name` | Channel attachment validation failure |

## Impact

This error prevents the affected channel operation from completing. The channel cannot be created, attached to, or used until the name is corrected. Other channels and operations continue to function normally.

The error will not be automatically retried as it indicates a client-side configuration issue that requires correction.

## Quick fixes

1. Remove square brackets from the start of channel names unless using valid qualifiers
2. Ensure channel names have content after any qualifier: `[meta]channelName`, not just `[meta]`
3. Close all qualifier brackets properly: `[meta]channel`, not `[meta-channel`
4. Avoid special characters in qualifiers - use only allowed qualifier names

## Troubleshooting

The following are common causes and resolutions for error 40010:

### Malformed channel qualifier syntax

| Error Message |
|---------------|
| `Invalid qualifier in channelId` or `regex match failed` |

This occurs when:
- Square brackets are not properly closed
- Invalid characters appear in the qualifier section
- The qualifier format doesn't match the expected pattern

To resolve this:
1. Ensure all square brackets are properly paired: `[qualifier]channel`
2. Use only valid qualifiers: `meta`, `presence`, `push`, or channel parameters like `?rewind=1`
3. Check that no invalid characters (like `?`) appear inside the qualifier name itself

<Code>
```javascript
// Incorrect - missing closing bracket
channel = realtime.channels.get('[meta-channel');

// Correct
channel = realtime.channels.get('[meta]channel');

// Incorrect - invalid character in qualifier
channel = realtime.channels.get('[meta?data]channel');

// Correct - parameters use different syntax
channel = realtime.channels.get('[?rewind=1]channel');
```
</Code>

### Empty channel name after qualifier

| Error Message |
|---------------|
| `Invalid channel name` |

This occurs when:
- A qualifier is present but no channel name follows it
- The channel name portion is empty after the closing bracket

To resolve this:
Ensure there's always a channel name after any qualifier:

<Code>
```javascript
// Incorrect - no channel name after qualifier
channel = realtime.channels.get('[meta]');

// Correct
channel = realtime.channels.get('[meta]my-channel');
```
</Code>
{/* Source: Pattern from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/40010-analysis.md lines 29-30 */}

### Incompatible channel options

| Error Message |
|---------------|
| `cannot use a derived option with a {type} channel` |

This occurs when:
- Attempting to apply channel options to an already-qualified channel
- Using setOptions() on channels with existing qualifiers

To resolve this:
Apply all channel options during initial channel creation, not afterwards:

<Code>
```javascript
// Incorrect - applying options to qualified channel
const qualified = realtime.channels.get('[meta]channel');
qualified.setOptions({ params: { rewind: '1' } });

// Correct - include options in initial channel creation
const channel = realtime.channels.get('[?rewind=1]channel');
```
</Code>
{/* Source: Error case from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/40010-analysis.md lines 144-145 */}

### Channel names starting with square brackets

| Error Message |
|---------------|
| `Invalid channel name` |

This occurs when:
- Channel names start with `[` without being a valid qualifier
- Square brackets are used incorrectly in the channel name

To resolve this:
Only start channel names with square brackets when using valid qualifiers. For regular channel names, avoid starting with `[`:

<Code>
```javascript
// Incorrect - square bracket without valid qualifier
channel = realtime.channels.get('[my-channel');

// Correct - either use valid qualifier or no brackets
channel = realtime.channels.get('my-channel');
channel = realtime.channels.get('[meta]my-channel');
```
</Code>

## Prevention

To prevent this error:

1. **Understand channel naming rules**: Channel names can contain any unicode character but cannot start with `[` unless using a valid qualifier
2. **Validate channel names client-side**: Implement validation before attempting to create or attach to channels
3. **Use helper functions**: Create utilities to build qualified channel names correctly
4. **Review the channel documentation**: Consult the [Ably channels documentation](https://ably.com/docs/channels) for complete naming guidelines
