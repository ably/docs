This guide will help you get started with Ably Chat in a new JVM application using Kotlin.

You'll learn how to create chat rooms, send and edit messages, and implement realtime features like typing indicators and presence. You'll also cover message history, reactions, and proper connection management.

## Prerequisites <a id="prerequisites"/>

### Ably <a id="prerequisites-ably"/>

1. [Sign up](https://ably.com/signup) for an Ably account.

2. Create a [new app](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/new), and get your first API key. You can use the root API key that is provided by default, within the **API Keys** tab to get started.

### Create a new project <a id="prerequisites-project"/>

Create a new JVM project using Gradle or Maven. We'll use Gradle with Kotlin DSL for this guide:

1. Create a new directory for your project:

<Code>
```shell
mkdir chat-jvm-example
cd chat-jvm-example
```
</Code>

2. Initialize a new Gradle project:

<Code>
```shell
gradle init --type kotlin-application
```
</Code>

3. Update your `build.gradle.kts` file to include the Ably dependencies:

<Code>
```kotlin
implementation("com.ably.chat:chat:<latest-version>")

// We will need Kotlin coroutines for this demo
implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.9.0")

// Required so that slf4j has an implementation to log to
implementation("org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:2.0.17")
```
</Code>

### (Optional) Install Ably CLI <a id="install-cli"/>

The [Ably CLI](https://github.com/ably/cli) provides a command-line interface for managing your Ably applications directly from your terminal.

1. Install the Ably CLI:

<Code>
```shell
npm install -g @ably/cli
```
</Code>

2. Run the following to log in to your Ably account and set the default app and API key:

<Code>
```shell
ably login
```
</Code>

<If loggedIn={false}>
  <Aside data-type='note'>
  The code examples in this guide include a demo API key. If you wish to interact with the Ably CLI and view outputs within your Ably account, ensure that you replace them with your own API key.
  </Aside>
</If>

## Step 1: Connect to Ably <a id="step-1"/>

Clients establish a connection with Ably when they instantiate an SDK. This enables them to send and receive messages in realtime across channels.

Add the following code to the `App.kt` file created by `gradle init` set up the Ably client.

Note that this is for example purposes only. In production, you should use [token authentication](/docs/auth/token) to avoid exposing your API keys publicly. The [`clientId`](/docs/auth/identified-clients) is used to identify the client when using an API key:

<Code>
```kotlin
package com.example

import com.ably.chat.*
import com.ably.chat.json.*
import io.ably.lib.realtime.AblyRealtime
import io.ably.lib.types.ClientOptions
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat
import java.util.*

val ABLY_KEY = "{{API_KEY}}"

suspend fun main() {
    demonstrateMessages()
}

suspend fun demonstrateMessages() {
    val realtimeClient = AblyRealtime(
        ClientOptions().apply {
            // In production, you should use token authentication to avoid exposing your API keys publicly
            key = ABLY_KEY
            clientId = "my-first-client"
        }
    )

    val chatClient = ChatClient(realtimeClient) { logLevel = LogLevel.Info }

    // Monitor connection status
    val (off) = chatClient.connection.onStatusChange { change ->
        println("Connection status: ${change.current}")
    }

    println("Chat client initialized. Connection status: ${chatClient.connection.status}")

    // Keep the application running
    delay(5000)
    off()
    realtimeClient.close()
}
```
</Code>

Run the application with `./gradlew run`. You should see the connection status logged to the console.

## Step 2: Create a room and send a message <a id="step-2"/>

Messages are how your clients interact with one another. Use rooms to separate and organize clients and messages into different topics, or 'chat rooms'. Rooms are the entry object into Chat, providing access to all of its features, such as messages, presence and reactions.

Update your `demonstrateMessages` function to create a room, attach to it, and send a message:

<Code>
```kotlin
suspend fun demonstrateMessages() {
    val realtimeClient = AblyRealtime(
        ClientOptions().apply {
            key = ABLY_KEY
            clientId = "my-first-client"
        }
    )

    val chatClient = ChatClient(realtimeClient) { logLevel = LogLevel.Info }

    // Monitor connection status
    chatClient.connection.onStatusChange { change ->
        println("Connection status: ${change.current}")
    }

    // Get and attach to a room
    val room = chatClient.rooms.get("my-first-room")
    room.attach()

    println("Room '${room.name}' status: ${room.status}")

    // Subscribe to messages
    val (unsubscribe) = room.messages.subscribe { messageEvent ->
        val message = messageEvent.message
        val timestamp = SimpleDateFormat("HH:mm:ss", Locale.getDefault()).format(Date(message.timestamp))
        println("[$timestamp] ${message.clientId}: ${message.text}")
    }

    // Send a message
    val myMessage = room.messages.send("Hello from JVM!")
    println("Sent message with serial: ${myMessage.serial}")

    // Keep listening for messages
    println("Listening for messages... (press Ctrl+C to exit)")
    delay(30000) // Keep running for 30 seconds

    // Clean up
    unsubscribe()
    room.detach()
    realtimeClient.close()
}
```
</Code>

Run the application again with `./gradlew run`. You'll see your message appear in the console.

You can also use the Ably CLI to send a message to the room from another environment:

<Code>
```shell
ably rooms messages send my-first-room 'Hello from CLI!'
```
</Code>

You should see the CLI message appear in your application's console output.

## Step 3: Edit a message <a id="step-3"/>

If your client makes a typo, or needs to update their original message then they can edit it.

Update the code from Step 2 for creating a subscription and sending a message to also handle message edits:

<Code>
```kotlin
// Subscribe to message updates
val subscription = room.messages.subscribe { messageEvent ->
    val message = messageEvent.message
    val timestamp = SimpleDateFormat("HH:mm:ss", Locale.getDefault()).format(Date(message.timestamp))

    when (messageEvent.type) {
        ChatMessageEventType.Created -> {
            println("[$timestamp] NEW: ${message.clientId}: ${message.text}")
        }
        ChatMessageEventType.Updated -> {
            println("[$timestamp] EDITED: ${message.clientId}: ${message.text}")
        }
        else -> Unit
    }
}

// Send and then edit a message
val myMessage = room.messages.send("Hello from JVM!")
println("Sent message with serial: ${myMessage.serial}")

delay(1000) // Wait a bit

// Edit the message
val editedMessage = myMessage.copy(text = "Hello from JVM! (edited)")
room.messages.update(editedMessage)
println("Updated message with serial: ${myMessage.serial}")

// Wait a bit to receive messages
delay(5000)
```
</Code>

When you run the application, you'll see both the original message and the edited version in the console.

## Step 4: Message history and continuity <a id="step-4"/>

Ably Chat provides a method for retrieving messages that have been previously sent in a room, up until the point that a client joins (attaches) to it. This enables clients joining a room part way through a conversation to receive the context of what has happened, and what is being discussed.

Use the Ably CLI to send some additional messages to your room, for example:

<Code>
```shell
ably rooms messages send my-first-room 'Historical message 1'
ably rooms messages send my-first-room 'Historical message 2'
ably rooms messages send my-first-room 'Historical message 3'
```
</Code>

Create a new function to demonstrate retrieving message history:

<Code>
```kotlin
suspend fun demonstrateHistory() {
    val realtimeClient = AblyRealtime(
        ClientOptions().apply {
            key = ABLY_KEY
            clientId = "history-client"
        }
    )

    val chatClient = ChatClient(realtimeClient) { logLevel = LogLevel.Info }

    val room = chatClient.rooms.get("my-first-room")
    room.attach()

    // Subscribe to new messages and get historical messages
    val (unsubscribe, subscription) = room.messages.subscribe { messageEvent ->
        println("NEW MESSAGE: ${messageEvent.message.clientId}: ${messageEvent.message.text}")
    }

    // Retrieve the last 10 messages
    val historicalMessages = subscription.historyBeforeSubscribe(limit = 10)

    println("=== HISTORICAL MESSAGES ===")
    historicalMessages.items.reversed().forEach { message ->
        val timestamp = SimpleDateFormat("HH:mm:ss", Locale.getDefault()).format(Date(message.timestamp))
        println("[$timestamp] ${message.clientId}: ${message.text}")
    }
    println("=== END HISTORY ===")

    delay(10000)
    unsubscribe()
    room.detach()
    realtimeClient.close()
}
```
</Code>

Update your main function to call this new function:

<Code>
```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
    demonstrateHistory()
}
```
</Code>

You should now see the message that you have previously sent in this chat room.

## Step 5: Show who is typing a message <a id="step-5"/>

Typing indicators enable you to display messages to clients when someone is currently typing. An event is emitted when someone starts typing, when they press a keystroke, and then another event is emitted after a configurable amount of time has passed without a key press.

Add typing functionality to your main application:

<Code>
```kotlin
suspend fun demonstrateTyping() {
    val realtimeClient = AblyRealtime(
        ClientOptions().apply {
            key = ABLY_KEY
            clientId = "typing-client"
        }
    )

    val chatClient = ChatClient(realtimeClient) { logLevel = LogLevel.Info }

    val room = chatClient.rooms.get("my-first-room")
    room.attach()

    // Subscribe to typing events
    val (unsubscribe) = room.typing.subscribe { typingEvent ->
        if (typingEvent.currentlyTyping.isEmpty()) {
            println("No one is currently typing")
        } else {
            println("${typingEvent.currentlyTyping.joinToString(", ")} is typing...")
        }
    }

    // Simulate typing
    println("Starting to type...")
    room.typing.keystroke()

    delay(2000)

    println("Stopping typing...")
    room.typing.stop()

    delay(5000)
    unsubscribe()
    room.detach()
    realtimeClient.close()
}
```
</Code>

Update your main function to call this new function:

<Code>
```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
    demonstrateTyping()
}
```
</Code>

You can also use the Ably CLI to simulate typing events:

<Code>
```shell
ably rooms typing subscribe my-first-room
```
</Code>

## Step 6: Display online status <a id="step-6"/>

Display the online status of clients using the presence feature. This enables clients to be aware of one another if they are present in the same room.

Add presence functionality:

<Code>
```kotlin
suspend fun demonstratePresence() {
    val realtimeClient = AblyRealtime(
        ClientOptions().apply {
            key = ABLY_KEY
            clientId = "presence-client"
        }
    )

    val chatClient = ChatClient(realtimeClient) { logLevel = LogLevel.Info }

    val room = chatClient.rooms.get("my-first-room")
    room.attach()

    // Subscribe to presence events
    val (unsubscribe) = room.presence.subscribe { presenceEvent ->
        val member = presenceEvent.member
        when (presenceEvent.type) {
            PresenceEventType.Enter -> {
                println("${member.clientId} entered the room with data: ${member.data}")
            }
            PresenceEventType.Leave -> {
                println("${member.clientId} left the room with data: ${member.data}")
            }
            PresenceEventType.Update -> {
                println("${member.clientId} updated their presence: ${member.data}")
            }
            PresenceEventType.Present -> {
                println("${member.clientId} is present with data: ${member.data}")
            }
        }
    }

    // Enter the presence set
    room.presence.enter(
        jsonObject {
            addProperty("status", "Online")
        },
    )
    println("Entered presence set")

    // Get current presence members
    val members = room.presence.get()
    println("Currently online (${members.size} members):")
    members.forEach { member ->
        println("  - ${member.clientId}: ${member.data}")
    }

    delay(10000)

    // Leave presence before closing
    room.presence.leave(
        jsonObject {
            put("status", "Offline")
        },
    )

    delay(1000)
    unsubscribe()
    room.detach()
    realtimeClient.close()
}
```
</Code>

Update your main function to call this new function:

<Code>
```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
    demonstratePresence()
}
```
</Code>

Use the Ably CLI to join the presence set from another client:

<Code>
```shell
ably rooms presence enter my-first-room --data '{"status":"learning about Ably!"}'
```
</Code>

## Step 7: Send a room reaction <a id="step-7"/>

Clients can send an ephemeral reaction to a room to show their sentiment for what is happening, such as a point being scored in a sports game.

Add reaction functionality:

<Code>
```kotlin
suspend fun demonstrateReactions() {
    val realtimeClient = AblyRealtime(
        ClientOptions().apply {
            key = ABLY_KEY
            clientId = "reaction-client"
        }
    )

    val chatClient = ChatClient(realtimeClient) { logLevel = LogLevel.Info }

    val room = chatClient.rooms.get("my-first-room")
    room.attach()

    // Subscribe to reactions
    val (unsubscribe) = room.reactions.subscribe { event ->
        println("${event.reaction.clientId} reacted with: ${event.reaction.name}")
    }

    // Send some reactions
    val reactions = listOf("👍", "❤️", "🚀", "🎉")

    for (reaction in reactions) {
        room.reactions.send(reaction)
        println("Sent reaction: $reaction")
        delay(1000)
    }

    delay(5000)
    unsubscribe()
    room.detach()
    realtimeClient.close()
}
```
</Code>

Update your main function to call this new function:

<Code>
```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
    demonstrateReactions()
}
```
</Code>

Use the Ably CLI to send reactions to the room:

<Code>
```shell
ably rooms reactions send my-first-room 👍
ably rooms reactions send my-first-room 🎉
```
</Code>

## Step 8: Close the connection <a id="step-8"/>

Connections are automatically closed approximately 2 minutes after no heartbeat is detected by Ably. Explicitly closing connections when they are no longer needed is good practice to help save costs. It will also remove all listeners that were registered by the client.

Add proper connection management to your application:

<Code>
```kotlin
suspend fun fullChatDemo() {
    val realtimeClient = AblyRealtime(
        ClientOptions().apply {
            key = ABLY_KEY
            clientId = "demo-client"
        }
    )

    val chatClient = ChatClient(realtimeClient) { logLevel = LogLevel.Info }
    val room = chatClient.rooms.get("my-first-room")

    try {
        // Connection monitoring
        chatClient.connection.onStatusChange { change ->
            println("Connection status changed to: ${change.current}")
        }

        // Attach the room
        room.attach()

        println("=== Full Chat Demo Started ===")

        // Subscribe to all events
        room.messages.subscribe { messageEvent ->
            val message = messageEvent.message
            val timestamp = SimpleDateFormat("HH:mm:ss", Locale.getDefault()).format(Date(message.timestamp))
            val eventType = if (messageEvent.type == ChatMessageEventType.Created) "NEW" else "EDIT"
            println("[$timestamp] $eventType: ${message.clientId}: ${message.text}")
        }

        room.presence.subscribe { presenceEvent ->
            println("PRESENCE: ${presenceEvent.member.clientId} ${presenceEvent.type}")
        }

        room.reactions.subscribe { event ->
            println("${event.reaction.clientId} reacted with: ${event.reaction.name}")
        }

        room.typing.subscribe { typingEvent ->
            val typingUsers = typingEvent.currentlyTyping.joinToString(", ")
            if (typingUsers.isNotEmpty()) {
                println("TYPING: $typingUsers is typing...")
            }
        }

        // Enter presence
        room.presence.enter(
            jsonObject {
                put("status", "Online")
            },
        )

        // Send a message
        room.messages.send("Hello everyone! This is a JVM chat client.")

        // Send a reaction
        room.reactions.send("🎉")

        // Demonstrate typing
        room.typing.keystroke()
        delay(2000)
        room.typing.stop()

        println("Demo running... Send messages via CLI or wait for auto-close")
        delay(30000) // Run for 30 seconds

    } catch (e: Exception) {
        println("Error: ${e.message}")
    } finally {
        // Always close the connection
        println("=== Closing connection ===")
        realtimeClient.close()
        room.detach()
        println("Connection closed")
    }
}

suspend fun main() {
    fullChatDemo()
}
```
</Code>

This demonstrates proper resource management and graceful shutdown of the chat client.
