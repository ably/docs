This error code is a protocol acknowledgment used when the Ably protocol requires an `ErrorInfo` object even though no actual error has occurred. It appears during normal connection lifecycle operations.

| Error code | HTTP status code | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 20000 | 200 or 204 | Protocol Acknowledgment | No |

## Error messages

| Message | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `Transport superseded` | A newer transport has replaced an existing one (normal during connection upgrades) |
| `Transport superseded as active transport` | The active transport has been replaced (expected behavior) |
| `Connection superseded` | A new connection has replaced the current one |
| `Client no longer needed, resource being disposed` | Resource cleanup in progress |
| `Coordinator idle (no existing coordinator and create-on-request disabled)` | Coordinator entering idle state |
| `Declining token as not active` | Channel declining a lifecycle token |
| `Unable to hand token off to successor` | Token handoff failed during channel relocation |
| `Transient attachment detaching` | Temporary channel attachment is detaching |

## Impact

This error code has **no negative impact** on your application. It's an informational status used for protocol compliance.

The Ably SDK handles this automatically - no intervention or retry is needed from your application.

## Why am I seeing this?

{/* Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/20000-analysis.md lines 85-113 */}
Error code 20000 appears in logs during these normal operations:

### Transport lifecycle management

This occurs when:
- The SDK upgrades from HTTP polling to WebSocket
- Multiple connection attempts resolve to a single connection
- Authentication parameters are updated mid-connection
- Connection recovery selects a better transport

{/* Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/20000-knowledge.md lines 86-88 */}
This is the most common scenario for error 20000 and represents normal SDK behavior as it optimizes your connection.

### Resource cleanup

This occurs when:
- Unused connections are being disposed
- Global resources are cleaned up
- Coordinators enter an idle state

These are routine housekeeping operations that ensure efficient resource usage.

### Channel token management

This occurs when:
- Channels undergo relocation on the backend
- Inactive channels decline lifecycle tokens
- Token handoffs occur during infrastructure changes

This is part of Ably's distributed architecture management and requires no action from you.

## Resolution

**No action is required** - this is not an actual error.

If you're concerned about seeing error 20000 in your logs:

1. **Verify your application is functioning normally** - Check that messages are being sent and received as expected
2. **Review the specific message text** - The message indicates which normal operation occurred (e.g., "Transport superseded" means a connection upgrade happened)
3. **Consider your logging configuration** - Since this is informational, you may want to filter it from error logs

If you're experiencing actual connectivity issues alongside error 20000, the root cause is likely a different error code that should also be present in your logs.

## Prevention

While error 20000 doesn't need prevention (it's normal behavior), you can reduce its appearance in logs by:

- Filtering error code 20000 from your error monitoring, as it's informational only
- Understanding that frequent appearance during connection establishment is expected
- Not treating HTTP status 204 responses with error 20000 as failures

## Need further help?

Contact [Ably support](https://ably.com/support) if you're still experiencing issues after trying the steps listed above.

You'll need to provide:

- Your account ID and app ID.
- The full error message including the error code.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any relevant code snippets (without any sensitive credentials).
- The SDK and version you're using.
