The [Ably dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts) is where you manage your apps and account. From here you can [create a new app](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/new) or select an existing one.

Learn more about [getting started with Ably](/docs/getting-started).

## Environments <a id="environment"/>

Each Ably app acts as a sandboxed environment, isolated from other apps in your account. Create separate apps for development, staging, and production.

<Aside data-type='important'>
While apps are sandboxed from each other, they share the same [account limits](/docs/platform/pricing/limits). A development app experiencing high usage could impact your production app if account limits are reached.

## Account settings <a id="account-settings"/>

The [Account settings page](https://ably.com/accounts/any/account) allows you to manage your account ID, [two-factor authentication (2FA)](/docs/platform/account/2fa), ownership, and account deletion.

Only the account owner can access account settings. Ownership can be transferred by contacting [Ably support](https://ably.com/support).

## Team <a id="team"/>

The [Team page](/docs/platform/account/team) manages who has access to your Ably account, including inviting members, assigning [roles](/docs/platform/account/team#roles), and managing permissions.

## Package and billing <a id="package"/>

The [Package page](https://ably.com/accounts/any/account/billing) manages your subscription plan and billing information. See [Ably pricing](/docs/platform/pricing) for details on available tiers.

Only the account owner can access billing pages and make package changes.

## Limits <a id="limits"/>

The [Limits page](/docs/platform/pricing/limits) shows your account's usage limits and current consumption, including messages, connections, channels, and API rates.

## Reports <a id="reports"/>

The [Reports section](/docs/platform/account/app/monitoring/reports) provides analytics on your account usage, including global usage and per-app breakdowns.
