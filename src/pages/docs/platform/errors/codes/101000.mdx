This error occurs when you attempt to get or create a space in the Ably Spaces SDK without providing a valid non-empty string as the space name.

| Error code | HTTP status code | Category | Retryable |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 101000 | 400 | Validation error | No |

## Impact

This error only impacts the current operation and prevents the space from being created or retrieved. The error is thrown immediately and synchronously, preventing any downstream operations.

The SDK will not automatically retry this operation as it's a validation error that requires fixing the input parameter.

## Troubleshooting

{/* Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/b819713/output/error-codes/research/101000-analysis.md lines 15-21 */}
This validation error occurs when the space name parameter is:
- An empty string (`""`)
- `null` or `undefined`
- A non-string value (number, object, array, etc.)

To resolve this error, provide a valid non-empty string as the space name:

<Code>
```javascript
// Incorrect usage that triggers error 101000
await spaces.get("");           // Empty string
await spaces.get(null);         // Null value
await spaces.get(undefined);    // Undefined
await spaces.get(123);          // Number instead of string

// Correct usage
await spaces.get("my-space");
await spaces.get("room-123");
await spaces.get("chat-" + userId);
```
</Code>

For robust error handling, validate the space name before passing it to the SDK:

<Code>
```javascript
function getSpace(name) {
  // Validate input before calling SDK
  if (typeof name !== 'string' || name.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('Space name must be a non-empty string');
  }

  return spaces.get(name);
}
```
</Code>

## Prevention

To prevent this error:

1. **Validate user input**: If space names come from user input, validate them before passing to the SDK
2. **Use meaningful identifiers**: Choose descriptive, non-empty names for your spaces
3. **Add type checking**: In TypeScript projects, leverage type safety to catch issues at compile time
4. **Implement error boundaries**: Wrap space operations in try-catch blocks to handle validation errors gracefully
