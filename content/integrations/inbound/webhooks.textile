External services can publish messages to Ably channels using the "REST API":/docs/api/rest-api, however, a simpler alternative is to use "incoming webhooks":#configure.

Many web services generate webhooks to communicate with applications. These webhooks are triggered based on interactions with their APIs or infrastructure. When a webhook request is received by Ably, its payload is published to a channel as an "unenveloped":/docs/api/rest-api#unenveloped message.

Ably also supports "outbound webhooks":/docs/integrations/webhooks, which send data from Ably to other external services such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform or Zapier.

h2(#configure). Configure an incoming webhook

Set up incoming webhooks in the Integrations tab of the "Ably dashboard":https://ably.com/accounts/any/app/any/integrations:

1. Click *Register a new webhook endpoint*.
2. *Name* your webhook.
3. *Select an Ably channel* to receive webhook messages.
4. Click *Generate a URL*.
5. Copy the generated URL and configure your external service with it.

h3(#test). Test incoming webhook

Run the following Curl command to simulate an incoming webhook request:

```[sh]
curl -X POST 'https://rest.ably.io/channels/webhook-test/messages?key={{API_KEY_NAME}}:{{API_KEY_SECRET}}&enveloped=false' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"some":"json"}'
```

Incoming webhooks function as REST publishes, meaning they follow the same behavior and functionality as the "REST publish API":/docs/api/rest-api#publish.

Ably responds with the @channel@ and @messageId@:

```[json]
{
	"channel": "webhook-test",
	"messageId": "20xxxxxxx"
}
```

A successful request returns a @201@ status. Failures return with an "@ErrorInfo@":/docs/api/rest-sdk/types#error-info response.

h2(#receive). Receive webhook messages

Incoming webhooks publish messages to an Ably channel. You can "subscribe":/docs/pub-sub#subscribe to these messages using an Ably SDK:

```[javascript]
const Ably = require("ably");

const ably = new Ably.Realtime('{{API_KEY}}');

const channel = ably.channels.get('webhook-test');

channel.subscribe((message) => {
    console.log(`webhook received: ${JSON.stringify(message.data)}`);
});
```

h2(#headers). Optional headers

The request body of incoming webhooks is treated as a message to be published. If the external service allows, you can customize webhook requests by including optional headers and parameters.

The following example demonstrates how to set a message @name@ using the @X-Ably-Name@ header:

```[sh]
curl -X POST 'https://rest.ably.io/channels/webhook-test/messages?key=key:secret&enveloped=false' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"some":"json"}' \
     -H 'X-Ably-Name: webhook-message'
```

Then, filter messages by name:

```[javascript]
channel.subscribe('webhook-message', (message) => {
    console.log("webhook: " + JSON.stringify(message.data));
});
```

To ensure that publishes are "idempotent":/docs/pub-sub/advanced#idempotency, add a unique @X-Ably-MessageId@ header.
