The demand for realtime apps and experiences is exploding, which is probably why you’re reading this vendor comparison. Current realtime data streaming providers can give you the much-needed core transfer infrastructure for realtime data - but they put the responsibility for managing realtime APIs back onto you, which can get messy and why we all use REST API management tools nowadays.

A couple of extra considerations when you’re choosing a realtime data streaming platform:

* In addition to the realtime streaming infrastructure, does the platform provide the operational tools you need to stream, manage, and exchange data in realtime? For example, analytics, developer portals, and rate limiting tools.
* Is end-to-end data delivery supported - from source to subscriber? This might be sending data straight from an IoT sensor to a smartphone, without needing to pass through your own servers first.
