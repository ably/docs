# Error 40800: Request timeout

## What Happened

Your request to Ably didn't complete within the allowed time limit, resulting in a timeout.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40800 | 408 | Client Error (Network) | Yes - temporary network issue |

## Quick Fix

- Check your network connectivity to Ably endpoints
- Verify firewall rules aren't blocking connections
- Consider network latency if seeing frequent timeouts
- For ping operations, ensure your connection is healthy

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Request timed out"
- "Unable to ping service; Request timed out"

## Common Causes

1. **Network connectivity issues** (50% of cases)
   - High network latency between client and Ably
   - Intermittent packet loss
   - Network congestion affecting request/response times
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 9-13 -->

2. **Ping operation timeouts** (25% of cases)
   - Connection health check failures
   - Server unresponsive to ping requests
   - Network path issues to Ably endpoints
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40800-analysis.md lines 16-22 and knowledge.md lines 49-54 -->

3. **HTTP request processing delays** (15% of cases)
   - Large payload processing times
   - Server processing delays during high load
   - Response body logging timeouts
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40800-analysis.md lines 33-45 -->

4. **Queue system timeouts** (10% of cases)
   - Queue operations exceeding timeout threshold
   - Message processing delays
   - Queue system overload conditions
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40800-analysis.md lines 26-31 and knowledge.md lines 62-65 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify network connectivity**
   - Test connectivity to Ably endpoints:
     - REST API: `rest.ably.io`
     - Realtime: `realtime.ably.io`
   - Check for packet loss using network diagnostic tools
   - Ensure your internet connection is stable
   <!-- Source: Knowledge recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 87-90 -->

2. **Review firewall and proxy settings**
   - Ensure port 443 (HTTPS/WebSocket) is open for Ably domains
   - Whitelist these domains:
     - `*.ably.io`
     - `*.ably-realtime.com`
     - `ws-up.ably-realtime.com` (for WebSocket connectivity checks)
   - Check proxy timeout settings if using a proxy server
   - Confirm DNS resolution is working correctly
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 87-90 and FAQ documentation -->

3. **For ping timeout issues specifically**
   - Monitor connection state before attempting ping operations
   - Consider implementing custom health check intervals
   - Use connection state listeners to detect issues proactively
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40800-analysis.md lines 16-22 -->

4. **Adjust timeout configuration (if available)**
   - Some SDKs allow configuring timeout values
   - Increase timeout for high-latency environments
   - Balance between responsiveness and reliability based on your network conditions
   <!-- Source: Knowledge recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 29-31 -->

5. **Monitor for patterns**
   - Check if timeouts occur at specific times of day
   - Look for correlation with network events or maintenance windows
   - Track timeout frequency to identify systemic issues
   - Review application logs for timeout patterns
   <!-- Source: Knowledge recommendation from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40800-knowledge.md lines 35-38 -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs implement automatic retry logic for timeout errors:
- The SDK will retry the request with appropriate backoff strategies
- Connection recovery mechanisms handle transient network issues automatically
- You don't need to implement manual retry logic for most timeout scenarios
- Ping operations will be retried as part of connection health monitoring
<!-- Source: Analysis of SDK behavior from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/40800-analysis.md lines 59-62 -->

## Prevention

- **Monitor network quality**: Regularly check connection quality to Ably endpoints
- **Configure appropriate timeouts**: Set timeout values based on your network conditions and use case
- **Use connection state listeners**: Monitor connection state to detect issues early
- **Implement fallback strategies**: Have contingency plans for degraded network conditions
- **Optimize payload sizes**: Keep message sizes reasonable to avoid processing delays
