The occupancy feature enables you to view the number of occupants attached to a channel and specific metrics about their connections.

The metrics returned by the occupancy feature include the number of:

* clients attached to a channel.
* clients authorized to subscribe to messages on a channel.
* clients authorized to publish to a channel.
* "presence":/core-features/presence members currently present on a channel.
* connections authorized to subscribe to presence events.
* connections authorized to publish presence events.

Query the "channel status API":/rest/channel-status to return the occupancy metrics of a channel. Alternatively, configure a "@channel.occupancy@ rule source":/general/webhooks#sources or subscribe to "inband channel occupancy events":/realtime/inband-occupancy for a channel.

h2(#occupancy-presence). Occupancy and presence

The occupancy and presence features differ in the following ways:

- Occupancy := provides metrics about the clients attached to a channel. This includes a count of the number of clients attached, the number of publishers and subscribers, the number of presence members, and the number of presence publishers and subscribers.

- Presence := provides information about the activity of members entered into the presence set of a channel. Presence members announce their state to presence subscribers via presence events. For example, when entering the presence set, leaving the presence set, or updating their member data.
