      LiveSync enables you to synchronize changes in your database to frontend clients at scale. LiveSync is designed to be database agnostic with support for PostgreSQL in its Alpha release version. It uses Ably's global message delivery network to sync app data in realtime.

      LiveSync is made up of two components: the Database Connector and the Models SDK. The Database Connector is a backend service that enables you to broadcast realtime changes from your database. The Models SDK is a frontend library that simplifies subscribing to changes in data models, applying optimistic updates and merging them with confirmed updates.
