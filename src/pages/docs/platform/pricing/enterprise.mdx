Custom packages to meet all of your business needs.

## Features <a id="features"/>

Enterprise packages can include features such as:

* **HIPAA BAA**: Ably is [HIPAA compliant](https://faqs.ably.com/are-you-hipaa-compliant) and can sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in most cases.
* **Regional data constraints**: require that all traffic is routed and serviced only within specific regions, such as EU-only, or US-only.
* **Custom CNAMEs**: use your own custom domain, or a subdomain of Ably for your application or service.
* **SAML and SCIM**: authenticate with Ably using your own Identity Provider (IdP) and automatically provision users within your Ably account.
* **Active traffic management**: Ably can monitor the health of your own endpoints and proactively take steps to isolate, or move, traffic to ensure business continuity.
* **DataDog**: send metrics from Ably into your [DataDog](/docs/integrations/streaming/datadog) account.
* **PrivateLink**: enable traffic from your users and servers into Ably without using the public internet via [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/).
* **Private clusters**:  guaranteed capacity and isolation from all other Ably users.
