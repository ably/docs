Ably integrations enable you to send your data from Ably to an external service or push data into Ably from an external service.

## Inbound integrations <a id="inbound"/>

Inbound integrations are where one of your external systems is sending data into Ably.

* [Inbound webhooks](/docs/integrations/inbound/webhooks) enable you to configure an endpoint for generated requests to be picked up by Ably and published to a channel.
* The [Kafka connector](/docs/integrations/inbound/kafka-connector) enables you to send data from one or more Kafka topics into Ably channels.

## Outbound webhooks <a id="outbound"/>

[Outbound webhooks](/docs/integrations/webhooks) enable you to push data to an external system from within Ably. These events that happen within Ably include messages being published to a channel, presence events being emitted, and changes in the channel occupancy and activity.

The following pre-built webhooks can be configured:

* [AWS Lambda functions](/docs/platform/integrations/webhooks/lambda)
* [Google Cloud functions](/docs/platform/integrations/webhooks/gcp-function)
* [Zapier](/docs/platform/integrations/webhooks/zapier)
* [Cloudflare Workers](/docs/platform/integrations/webhooks/cloudflare)
* [IFTTT](/docs/platform/integrations/webhooks/ifttt)
* [Datadog](/docs/platform/integrations/streaming/datadog)

## Outbound streaming <a id="continuous"/>

[Outbound streaming](/docs/integrations/streaming) involves streaming a constant flow of data from Ably to other streaming or queuing services. This is useful for integrating Ably with large-scale, event-driven architectures or data pipelines.

The following pre-built services can be configured:

* [Kafka](/docs/integrations/streaming/kafka)
* [AWS Kinesis](/docs/integrations/streaming/kinesis)
* [AMQP](/docs/integrations/streaming/amqp)
* [AWS SQS](/docs/integrations/streaming/sqs)
* [Apache Pulsar](/docs/integrations/streaming/pulsar)

## Message queues <a id="queues"/>

[Message queues](/docs/integrations/queues) enable asynchronous communication between a queueing pattern. Producers (Ably channels) publish messages to a queue, and consumers retrieve them in a first-in, first-out order.

Whilst pub-sub channels broadcast messages to all subscribers, queues distribute work among consumers. Both patterns serve different use cases. For example, pub/sub is ideal for many users to receive realtime updates, while queues handle tasks like triggering emails efficiently.

## Skip integrations <a id="skip"/>

Privileged users can [skip integrations](docs/platform/integrations/skip-integrations) on a per-message basis, providing greater control and flexibility when publishing messages to a channel.
