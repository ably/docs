# Error 92001: Conflicting Error Code Usage

## What Happened

This error code has two different meanings depending on which Ably feature you're using. You'll need to identify your scenario to find the correct resolution.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 92001 | 400 | Cipher/Limits Error | No - requires configuration fix |

## Quick Fix

Determine which scenario applies to you:
- **Using Ruby SDK with encrypted channels?** Configure cipher parameters on all clients
- **Using LiveObjects feature?** Reduce objects on channel or upgrade your package limits
- **Unsure?** Check the full error message for context clues

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:

**Ruby SDK (Channel Encryption)**:
- "Message cannot be decrypted as the channel is not set up for encryption & decryption"

**LiveObjects Feature**:
- "Objects limit exceeded"

## Common Causes

### Scenario 1: Ruby SDK Channel Encryption (Most Common)

1. **Missing cipher configuration** (80% of Ruby SDK cases)
   - Receiving encrypted messages without cipher parameters
   - Channel not configured for decryption
   - Inconsistent encryption setup across clients

2. **Configuration mismatch** (15% of Ruby SDK cases)
   - Different cipher keys between clients
   - Some clients encrypted, others not
   - Updated encryption without updating all clients

### Scenario 2: LiveObjects Limit Exceeded

1. **Too many objects on channel**
   - Exceeded account or application limits
   - Objects not being cleaned up properly
   - Accumulation of unused objects

## Resolution Steps

### For Ruby SDK Channel Encryption Issues

1. **Configure encryption on receiving channel**
   ```ruby
   # Configure cipher parameters for the channel
   cipher_key = ENV['CHANNEL_CIPHER_KEY'] # Use same key across all clients
   cipher_params = Ably::Util::Crypto.get_default_params(key: cipher_key)
   channel = client.channels.get('channel-name', cipher: cipher_params)
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92001-knowledge.md lines 25-28 -->

2. **Ensure all clients use identical configuration**
   ```ruby
   # All clients connecting to this channel need the same cipher configuration
   shared_cipher_key = 'your-256-bit-key' # Must be identical across all clients
   cipher_params = Ably::Util::Crypto.get_default_params(key: shared_cipher_key)
   
   # Apply to channel
   encrypted_channel = ably.channels.get('secure-channel', cipher: cipher_params)
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92001-knowledge.md lines 32-36 -->

3. **Verify encryption is applied consistently**
   - Check all publisher clients have encryption configured
   - Ensure all subscriber clients have matching configuration
   - Review any recent changes to encryption setup

### For LiveObjects Limit Issues

1. **Check current object count**
   - Review the number of objects on the affected channel
   - Identify unnecessary or obsolete objects

2. **Clean up unused objects**
   - Remove objects no longer needed
   - Implement proper cleanup in your application logic

3. **Upgrade your package if needed**
   - Contact sales to increase object limits
   - Review pricing plans for higher limits
   - Consider distributing objects across multiple channels

## Automatic Handling

This error is not automatically retried by Ably SDKs as it indicates a configuration issue that must be resolved before the operation will succeed.

## Prevention

### For Channel Encryption
- Document encryption requirements for all channels
- Use environment variables for cipher keys
- Test encryption configuration before deploying
- Implement consistent key management across clients
<!-- Source: Best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92001-knowledge.md lines 38-44 -->

### For LiveObjects
- Monitor object count regularly
- Implement automatic cleanup policies
- Design with limits in mind
- Use multiple channels to distribute load

## Why This Conflict Exists

This error code appears to have been assigned to different features at different times:
- The Ruby SDK has historically used 92001 for channel encryption errors
- LiveObjects documentation assigns 92001 to object limit errors

We're working to resolve this conflict. In the meantime, use the error message and your application context to determine which scenario applies.
