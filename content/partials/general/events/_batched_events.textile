Each batched message will have the following fields:

- name := the event type, aka "@presence.message@", "@channel.message@", "@channel.closed@", etc
- webhookId := an internal unique ID for the configured webhook
- source := the source for the webhook, namely "@channel.message@", "@channel.presence@", "@channel.lifecycle@"
- timestamp := a timestamp represented as milliseconds since the epoch for the presence event
- data := an object containing the data of the event defined below in "JSONPath format":http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath

h4(#batch-example-message). Batched message events

For @message@ events, @data@ will contain:

- data.channelId := name of the channel that the presence event belongs to
- data.site := an internal site identifier indicating which primary datacenter the member is present in
- data.messages := an @Array@ of raw messages

h5(#batch-example-message-decoding). Decoding batched messages

Messages sent "over the realtime service":/realtime/channels are automatically decoded into "@Message@":/realtime/types#message objects by the Ably client library. With webhooks you need to to do this explicitly, using "@Message.fromEncodedArray@":/realtime/messages#message-from-encoded-array on the @data.messages@ array, or "@Message.fromEncoded@":/realtime/messages#message-from-encoded on an individual member of that array. This will transform them into an array of "@Message@":/realtime/types#message objects (or in the case of @fromEncoded@, an individual "@Message@":/realtime/types#message). This has several advantages, e.g.:

* It will fully decode any @data@ (using the @encoding@) back into the same datatype that it was sent in (or an equivalent in each client library's language)
* If you are using "encryption":/realtime/encryption, you can pass your encryption key to the method and it will decrypt the @data@ for you

We recommend you do this for all messages you receive over webhooks. For example (using ably-js):

```[javascript]
webhookMessage.items.forEach((item) => {
  const messages = Ably.Realtime.Message.fromEncodedArray(item.data.messages);
  messages.forEach((message) => {
    console.log(message.toString());
  })
})
```

h4(#batch-example-presence). Batched presence events

For @presence@ events, @data@ will contain:

- data.channelId := name of the channel that the presence event belongs to
- data.site := an internal site identifier indicating which primary datacenter the member is present in
- data.presence := an @Array@ of raw presence messages

This has several advantages, e.g.:

* It will decode the (numerical) action into a "@Presence action@":/realtime/presence#presence-action string (such as "@enter@", "@update@", or "@leave@")
* It will fully decode any @data@ (using the @encoding@) back into the same datatype that it was sent in (or an equivalent in each client library's language)
