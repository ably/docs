    # Chat API

    This API enables you to integrate certain chat functionality into your application without requiring a Chat SDK. It provides endpoints for sending and retrieving messages, updating and deleting messages, and fetching occupancy information for chat rooms.

    ## The Ably PubSub SDKs

    Whilst you can interact with these endpoints directly, it is recommended where possible to use the Ably PubSub SDKs - which provide a convenient `request` method for interacting with Ably APIs.
    By using this method, you can take advantage of built-in support for Ablyâ€™s authentication, pagination, and link headers, as well as automatic retry and fallback mechanics. This approach helps ensure consistent error handling, reduces setup overhead, and simplifies performing common operations against the Chat REST API. Using this method, instead of implementing your own request handling, will lead to more robust and maintainable client-side integrations.
