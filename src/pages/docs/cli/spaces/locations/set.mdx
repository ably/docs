```
</Code>

Use the `ably spaces locations set` command to set your location in a space.

Use another terminal instance and the [`ably spaces locations subscribe`](/docs/cli/spaces/locations/subscribe) command to view location updates as they occur, or use [`ably spaces locations get-all`](/docs/cli/spaces/locations/get-all) to view all current member locations.

## Arguments

### `<space>` <a id="space"/>

The space name to set location in, for example: `example-space`.

## Flags

Pass the following argument to the `ably spaces locations set` command:

### `--location` <a id="location"/>

Location data to set in JSON format. This is required and can contain any location information relevant to your application, for example:
- `{"x":10,"y":20}` for coordinates
- `{"sectionId":"section1","page":3}` for document sections
- `{"room":"A","floor":2}` for physical locations

You can optionally pass the following flags to the `ably spaces locations set` command:

### `--duration | -D` <a id="duration"/>

Automatically exit after the given number of seconds. Use `0` to exit immediately after setting location (default behavior).

## Global flags
