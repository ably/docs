# Error 65536: Not an error code

## What Happened

You've reached this page because you saw the number 65536 somewhere in Ably's documentation, logs, or error messages. However, **65536 is not an error code** - it's a configuration constant representing the maximum message size (64KB) allowed by the Ably protocol.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 65536 | N/A | Not an error code - Configuration constant | N/A |

## Quick Fix

- If you're seeing message size errors, look for **error code 40009** instead
- The value 65536 represents the 64KB maximum message size limit
- Check your message size and ensure it's under 64KB (65,536 bytes)

## Why You Might See This Number

The number 65536 appears in several contexts within Ably:

1. **Connection Details**: As `maxMessageSize: 65536` in connection parameters
2. **Error Messages**: When messages exceed 65536 bytes, you'll see error 40009 mentioning this limit
3. **SDK Constants**: As a configuration value in SDK source code
4. **Channel Flags**: As a bitwise flag value (unrelated to message size)

## Common Causes

If you're experiencing issues related to the 65536 value:

1. **Message Too Large** (Most common)
   - Your message exceeds the 64KB limit
   - You'll receive error code 40009: "Maximum message length exceeded"
   
2. **Configuration Inspection**
   - You're reviewing connection details
   - The value appears as a normal configuration parameter

3. **SDK Development**
   - You're working with Ably SDK source code
   - The constant appears in transport defaults

## Resolution Steps

### If Your Message Is Too Large

1. **Check the actual error code**
   - Look for error code **40009** in your logs
   - The error message will state: "Maximum message length exceeded size was X bytes, limit is 65536 bytes"

2. **Reduce your message size**
   - Keep messages under 64KB (65,536 bytes)
   - Consider splitting large messages into smaller chunks
   - Use compression if appropriate

3. **For batch operations**
   - Ensure the total size of all batched messages doesn't exceed 64KB
   - Split large batches into multiple publish operations

## The Actual Error for Size Violations

When a message exceeds 65536 bytes, you'll receive:
- **Error Code**: [40009](https://help.ably.io/error/40009)
- **HTTP Status**: 400 or 413
- **Message**: "Maximum message length exceeded"

<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/65536-knowledge.md lines 17-21 -->

## Technical Details

The value 65536 represents:
- **Size**: 64 kilobytes (KB)
- **Calculation**: 2^16 bytes
- **Scope**: Maximum size for a single message's data payload
- **Protocol**: Defined in Ably specification section CD2c
- **Coverage**: Applied consistently across all Ably SDKs

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Clear documentation about the 65536 constant appearing in connection details
- Impact: Users may be confused when they see this value and search for it as an error code
- Recommendation: Add a note in the limits documentation explaining common non-error numeric values
- Severity: Low - this is an edge case confusion
-->
