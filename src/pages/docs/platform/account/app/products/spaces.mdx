The Spaces section in your Ably dashboard provides a centralized hub for managing collaborative features and real-time interactions across your application. From this overview page, you can quickly access getting started guides for different platforms, explore ready-to-use examples, and review recent product updates through the changelog.

The dashboard makes it easy to jump into space monitoring, review implementation patterns, and stay updated with the latest Spaces features and fixes.

## Spaces <a id="spaces"/>

The spaces interface serves as your primary dashboard for monitoring and managing all collaborative activity across your application. This section provides real-time visibility into space performance, member connections, and interaction flow, enabling you to quickly identify issues and optimize your collaborative implementation.

Navigate to the spaces section through the dashboard sidebar under Products > Spaces > Spaces. The main spaces view displays all active spaces in a clean, searchable interface that makes it easy to monitor your entire collaborative infrastructure at a glance.

### Space browser functionality

The space finder search box allows you to quickly locate specific spaces by name - essential when managing applications with numerous collaboration areas across different features or namespaces. Simply enter a space name or partial match to filter the results and find the spaces you need to inspect.

The interface shows exactly how many spaces are currently active with the • Showing: 11 of 11 • counter, giving you immediate awareness of your application's collaborative scope and helping you track space growth over time.

Each space entry in the list displays key information for rapid assessment:

| Column | Information displayed | Purpose | Action available |
|---|---|---|---|
| Space name | The full identifier for the collaborative space | Identify specific spaces and namespaces | Click to sort alphabetically |
| Member count | Real-time number of members currently connected | Monitor activity patterns and detect issues | Compare across spaces |
| Inspect button | Eye icon for detailed space access | Access advanced monitoring and configuration | Click to view analytics, history, and settings |

The member count column is particularly valuable for identifying spaces experiencing high activity, unusual participation patterns, or potential connection issues. Spaces with unexpectedly high or low member counts can indicate performance problems, client-side issues, or changes in user behavior that need investigation.

## Space inspection <a id="inspection"/>

When you click the inspect button (eye icon) next to any space in the spaces list, you access a comprehensive space monitoring interface that provides deep visibility into that specific space's behavior, performance, and configuration.

### Space inspection overview

The inspection page opens with a detailed overview showing critical space information and real-time metrics. The header displays the full space name with a copy button for easy reference, along with breadcrumb navigation back to the main spaces list.

#### Live analytics and visualization

The inspection interface provides two primary analytics sections with live, updating charts that help you understand space behavior over time.

##### Messages analytics

The messages chart displays real-time inbound and outbound message flow with color-coded tracking for different message types. Use this to identify interaction patterns and delivery bottlenecks.

##### Occupancy analytics

The occupancy chart tracks connections, members, and presence data over time. Use this data to understand collaboration patterns and optimize your space architecture.

#### Space configuration and rules

The rules section provides comprehensive configuration options for controlling space behavior and security requirements. You can configure three categories of rules:

| Rule category | Purpose | Configuration options |
|---|---|---|
| Storage rules | Control message persistence and history retention | Persist last message, persist all messages |
| Space rules | Enforce security requirements | Identification required, TLS required |
| Feature rules | Enable advanced capabilities | Push notifications, message annotations/updates/deletes |

#### Integrations

The integrations section allows you to connect spaces to external services and configure automated workflows triggered by collaborative activity.

Use the **Add integration** button to set up new external connections.

#### Live logs and debugging

The live logs section provides essential debugging capabilities through real-time event monitoring and error tracking.

| Log type | Description |
|---|---|
| API requests | Monitor REST API calls and authentication attempts |
| Spaces | Track space creation, configuration changes, and lifecycle events |
| Connections | Monitor member connections, disconnections, and connection state changes |
| Integration errors | Identify webhook failures, external service timeouts, and integration issues |

When the logs display • No logs found • with • No active logs to display • this indicates normal space operation without errors or notable events. During active debugging or high-traffic periods, you'll see real-time event streams that help diagnose issues and verify system behavior.

## Connections <a id="connections"/>

The connections tab provides detailed visibility into all members currently connected to your space, enabling you to monitor individual member behavior and troubleshoot client-specific issues.

### Connection overview

When you select the connections tab from the space inspection interface, you'll see a comprehensive list of all active connections to that specific space. The interface displays key connection information in an organized table format.

The following outlines the connection information displayed:

| Column | Information displayed | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Connection ID | Unique identifier for each member connection | Track and reference specific connections |
| Client ID | Application-defined member identifier | Identify members in your application logic |
| Country | Geographic location of the connection | Monitor regional usage patterns |
| SDK | Client SDK version and platform | Debug compatibility and version issues |

The connection list shows practical information such as • Showing: 2 of 2 • to indicate the total number of active connections. Each connection entry includes an inspect button (eye icon) for detailed connection analysis.

### Individual connection inspection

When you click the inspect button on any connection, you access a detailed connection monitoring interface that provides comprehensive information about that specific member's behavior and configuration.

| Activity metric | Information displayed | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Inbound message rate | Messages per second sent by this member | Monitor member interaction activity |
| Outbound message rate | Messages per second delivered to this member | Track interaction delivery to member |

The activity chart visualizes interaction flow over time with separate tracking for inbound and outbound messages, helping you identify usage patterns and potential issues for individual connections.

#### Live logs

The live logs section shows real-time events specific to this connection, including connection establishment, interaction activity, and any errors:

| Log detail | Information displayed | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Timestamp | When each event occurred | Track event chronology |
| Resource ID | Which space or resource was involved | Identify affected resources |
| Event type | Type of connection event, for example connection.error, connection.attached | Categorize events |
