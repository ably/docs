LiveObjects provides a powerful synchronization mechanism to ensure that all clients see the same data. This document explains how synchronization works in LiveObjects.

## Channel objects <a id="channel-objects"/>

Ably maintains the authoritative state of all objects on each channel across its distributed infrastructure.

Each object instance is identified by a unique [object ID](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#object-ids). The channel holds the complete up-to-date data of all objects on the channel.

Ably stores the object data durably such that the data is available even after the channel becomes inactive. The data is stored in multiple regional datacenters and across multiple availability zones. This ensures that the data is available even if there is disruption in one or more datacenters.

When a channel first becomes active in a region, the channel loads the object data from durable storage into memory to facilitate low-latency operation processing.

## Client objects <a id="client-objects"/>

While Ably maintains the source of truth on the channel, each connected client keeps a local representation of the objects on the channel.

When the client first attaches to the channel, the state of the channel objects is streamed to the client. [Lifecycle events](/docs/liveobjects/lifecycle#synchronization) allow your application to be notified when the local state is being synchronized with the Ably service.

<If lang="javascript">
<Aside data-type='note'>
Calling [`channel.object.get()`](/docs/liveobjects/concepts/objects#channel-object) implicitly attaches to the channel and waits for synchronization.
</Aside>
</If>

All object operations published to the channel are broadcast to subscribed clients, which apply the operations to their local client objects when they are received. This allows clients to maintain a consistent view of the channel objects in a bandwidth-efficient way, since only the operations (rather than the updated objects themselves) are sent over the client's connection.

<If lang="javascript">
<Aside data-type='note'>
When a client publishes an operation, the operation is applied to its local objects as soon as the operation is acknowledged by the Ably system. This means that when a mutation method's promise resolves, the operation has already been applied and you can immediately read the updated state.
</Aside>

<Aside data-type='important'>
If you're also developing with the Swift or Java SDKs, note that they currently apply operations when [echoed](/docs/pub-sub/advanced#echo) back from the server rather than on acknowledgment. Apply-on-acknowledgment is coming soon to those SDKs.
</Aside>
</If>
<If lang="swift,java">
<Aside data-type='note'>
Currently, when a client publishes an operation it is not immediately applied to its local objects. Instead, the client only applies the operation when the operation is [echoed](/docs/pub-sub/advanced#echo) back to the client.
</Aside>
</If>

If there is a loss of continuity on the channel for any reason, such as the client becoming disconnected for more than two minutes and entering the [suspended state](/docs/connect/states#connection-states), the client objects will automatically be resynchronized when it reconnects.
