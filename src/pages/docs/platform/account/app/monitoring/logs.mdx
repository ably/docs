The Logs section in your Ably dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities through detailed event logging across all aspects of your application. Access your application logs in the [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/logs) under the Logs section. This interface enables you to track system activities, troubleshoot issues, and analyze patterns across API requests, channels, connections, integrations, and push notifications.

## Log sections overview <a id="sections-overview"/>

The logs interface is organized into five specialized sections, each focused on different aspects of your Ably implementation:

| Log section | Key use cases | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| API requests | Debug API integration issues and track request patterns | Monitor REST API calls and authentication attempts |
| Channels | Monitor channel lifecycle and message flow | Track channel events and activities |
| Connections | Troubleshoot connection issues and track client behavior | Monitor client connection events |
| Integration errors | Debug external service integrations and data flow | Track integration failures and webhook issues |
| Push notifications | Troubleshoot notification delivery issues | Monitor push notification delivery and errors |

Each section provides date range filtering and specialized search capabilities tailored to the specific type of events being monitored.
