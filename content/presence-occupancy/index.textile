"Presence":/presence-occupancy/presence and "occupancy":/presence-occupancy/occupancy are features that provide information about the clients and "connections":/connect attached to a channel. Occupancy returns high level metrics about the clients attached to a channel, whereas presence provides details about individual members that have joined a channel's presence set. 

h2(#presence-vs-occupancy). Occupancy vs. presence

Presence provides information about the activity of members entered into the presence set of a channel. Each member in the presence set can have data associated with them. Presence members announce their state to presence subscribers via presence events. For example, when entering the presence set, leaving the presence set, or updating their member data.  

Any change in the data of a member, or membership of the presence set, will trigger a presence event on the channel. This is useful for when you need to identify individual clients attached to the channel, or in instances where clients need to be aware of one another, for example, game or chat applications.

However, in large "channels":/channels with 1000s of users the level of detail provided by presence could become overwhelming and would impact an "account's message limit":/account/LINK-ME more. In those situations using occupancy to show just the number of active users might be better. 

Occupancy provides metrics about the clients attached to a channel. This includes a count of the number of clients attached, the number of publishers and subscribers, the number of presence members, and the number of presence publishers and subscribers. In situations where general information is more important than the specifics of individual connections, occupancy can provide the needed information without a stream of messages.
