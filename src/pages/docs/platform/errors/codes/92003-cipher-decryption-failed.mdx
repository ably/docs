# Error 92003: Cipher decryption failed

## What Happened

The SDK was unable to decrypt an encrypted message, typically because the decryption key doesn't match the key used for encryption.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 92003 | 400 | Cipher/Encryption Error | No - requires correct encryption key |

## Quick Fix

- Verify you're using the correct encryption key for this channel
- Ensure the key format matches (base64, hex, or raw)
- Check that both publisher and subscriber use identical cipher parameters

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "CipherError decrypting data, the private key may not be correct"
- OpenSSL cipher errors indicating decryption failure

## Common Causes

1. **Incorrect encryption key** (80% of cases)
   - Using wrong environment's key (dev vs production)
   - Key mismatch between publisher and subscriber
   - Copy-paste errors when configuring keys

2. **Key encoding issues** (15% of cases)
   - Base64 vs hex vs raw format confusion
   - Key truncation during configuration
   - Character encoding problems

3. **Key rotation without coordination** (5% of cases)
   - Publisher updated to new key
   - Subscriber still using old key
   - Messages encrypted with different keys in same channel

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify the encryption key**
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92003-knowledge.md lines 17-23 -->
   - Check you're using the correct key for your environment
   - Ensure the key hasn't been truncated or modified
   - Confirm both publisher and subscriber have the same key

2. **Check key encoding and format**
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/92003-analysis.md lines 34-37 -->
   - Verify if key should be base64, hex, or raw bytes
   - Ensure consistent encoding across all clients
   - Check for any character set conversion issues

3. **Review cipher parameters configuration**
   <!-- Source: Ably documentation at https://ably.com/docs/realtime/encryption -->
   - Confirm algorithm matches between encryption and decryption
   - Verify initialization vector (IV) handling if custom
   - Check cipher mode (CBC, GCM, etc.) consistency

4. **Test with known good configuration**
   - Try decrypting a test message with known parameters
   - Use Ably's default cipher params as baseline
   - Isolate whether issue is with specific messages or all encrypted data

## Automatic Handling

This is a configuration error that SDKs cannot automatically resolve. The application must provide the correct encryption key and parameters.

## Prevention

- Store encryption keys securely using vault or KMS services
- Implement key versioning for smooth rotation
- Test encryption/decryption in staging before production
- Monitor decryption failures for security alerts
- Document key distribution and rotation procedures

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Specific Ruby SDK cipher error handling examples
- Missing: Clear guidance on key rotation procedures with encryption
- Impact: Makes it harder for users to implement secure key management
- Recommendation: Add dedicated section on key rotation in encryption docs
- Severity: Medium - security-related documentation gaps
-->
