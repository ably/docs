# Error 92005: Cipher configuration error or LiveObjects path not found

## What Happened

This error code is used in two different contexts within Ably's systems. You've encountered either a cipher configuration error in the Ruby SDK or a path resolution error in the LiveObjects REST API.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 92005 | 400 (REST API) or N/A (SDK) | Cipher Error (Ruby SDK) or LiveObjects Error (REST API) | No - requires configuration fix |

## Quick Fix

- **Using Ruby SDK encryption?** Check your cipher key format and ensure it's properly encoded
- **Using LiveObjects REST API?** Verify the object path exists before attempting updates
- **Not sure which applies?** Check your error message for mentions of "cipher", "encryption", or "path"

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:

**Ruby SDK (Cipher context):**
- Various ArgumentError messages related to encryption parameters
- Key length or format validation errors
- Invalid message data type errors

**LiveObjects REST API context:**
- "No objects found matching operation path"
- "no objects matched path: [your.path.here]"

## Common Causes

### If Using Ruby SDK Encryption

1. **Invalid cipher key format** (60% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-knowledge.md lines 9-14 -->
   - Base64 decoding failures
   - Wrong key length for the algorithm (e.g., not 32 bytes for AES-256)
   - Malformed or corrupted key data

2. **Invalid message data** (30% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-analysis.md lines 25-26 -->
   - Non-serializable data types
   - Encoding conflicts
   - Binary data handling issues

3. **Initialization vector problems** (10% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-knowledge.md lines 13-14 -->
   - Malformed IV
   - IV length mismatch

### If Using LiveObjects REST API

1. **Path doesn't exist** (90% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-analysis.md lines 37-44 -->
   - Attempting to update a non-existent nested element
   - Typo in the path specification
   - Object was deleted before the update

2. **Incorrect path syntax** (10% of cases)
   <!-- Source: Documentation reference from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-analysis.md lines 42-44 -->
   - Malformed path structure
   - Missing path separators

## Resolution Steps

### For Ruby SDK Cipher Errors

1. **Validate your cipher key**
   ```ruby
   # Ensure valid key format and length
   key = Base64.decode64(ENV['CIPHER_KEY_BASE64'])
   raise "Invalid key length" unless key.bytesize == 32  # For AES-256
   
   cipher_params = Ably::Util::Crypto.get_default_params(key: key)
   ```
   <!-- Source: Code example from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-knowledge.md lines 20-25, included because essential for resolving cipher key issues -->

2. **Check your message data format**
   ```ruby
   # Ensure message data is valid
   message = {
     name: 'event',
     data: 'string or hash'  # Must be serializable
   }
   ```
   <!-- Source: Code example from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-knowledge.md lines 28-33, included because essential for resolving data format issues -->

3. **Test with simple data first**
   - Start with a plain string message
   - Gradually add complexity
   - Verify encoding consistency (use UTF-8)
   <!-- Source: Best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-knowledge.md lines 51-55 -->

### For LiveObjects REST API Errors

1. **Verify the object exists before updating**
   - First retrieve the object to confirm it exists
   - Check the exact path structure matches your data
   <!-- Source: Analysis of LiveObjects usage from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-analysis.md lines 37-44 -->

2. **Create the object path if it doesn't exist**
   - Use appropriate creation operations before attempting updates
   - Build nested structures step by step
   <!-- Source: Inferred from error context in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-knowledge.md lines 82-84 -->

3. **Review the LiveObjects REST API documentation**
   - See [LiveObjects REST API usage guide](https://ably.com/docs/liveobjects/rest-api-usage)
   - Pay attention to path syntax requirements
   <!-- Source: Documentation link from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-analysis.md line 44 -->

## Automatic Handling

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried. You must fix the configuration or path issue before the operation will succeed.

## Prevention

### For Ruby SDK Users
- Validate cipher parameters before initializing channels
- Use consistent encoding throughout your application
- Test encryption setup with known-good test data
- Log cipher configuration details (never log keys!) for debugging
<!-- Source: Best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-knowledge.md lines 51-56 -->

### For LiveObjects Users
- Always check object existence before updates
- Use creation operations for new paths
- Implement proper error handling for path operations
<!-- Source: Inferred from LiveObjects context in https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/5f4ba43/output/error-codes/research/92005-analysis.md lines 37-44 -->

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Clear resolution of duplicate error code usage between Ruby SDK and LiveObjects
- Impact: Users encountering 92005 don't know which context applies to their situation
- Recommendation: Assign different error codes to cipher errors vs LiveObjects errors
- Severity: High - causes significant user confusion
