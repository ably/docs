Monitor your Ably account limits, usage thresholds, and quota restrictions to ensure optimal service performance.

Account limits help protect your applications from unexpected usage spikes and ensure fair resource allocation across the Ably platform.

## Accessing account limits

To view your current limits:

1. Click Account in the top navigation bar
2. Select Limits from the dropdown menu
3. View your account limits dashboard

## Types of account limits

### Connection limits

Monitor concurrent connection restrictions:

| Limit Type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Peak concurrent connections | Maximum simultaneous connections allowed |
| Connection rate limits | Maximum new connections per time period |
| Connection duration limits | Maximum duration for individual connections |

### Message limits

Track message-related quotas:

| Limit Type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Message rate limits | Maximum messages per second/minute/hour |
| Message size limits | Maximum size per individual message |
| Daily/monthly message quotas | Total message allowances per time period |

### Channel limits

Understand channel restrictions:

| Limit Type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Peak concurrent channels | Maximum simultaneous channels |
| Channel creation rate | Maximum new channels per time period |
| Channel name length limits | Character restrictions for channel names |

### Data transfer limits

Monitor bandwidth restrictions:

| Limit Type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Bandwidth quotas | Data transfer allowances per time period |
| Payload size limits | Maximum data per message or event |
| History retention limits | Storage duration for message history |

## Understanding limit status

### Current usage display

The limits page shows:

- Current usage as a percentage of your limit
- Absolute numbers for both usage and limits
- Time period for rate-based limits
- Status indicators (green, yellow, red) for different usage levels

### Limit types explained

| Status | Description | Action Required |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| Green | Usage well below limits | No action needed |
| Yellow | Usage approaching limits | Monitor closely |
| Red | Usage at or near limits | Consider upgrading or optimizing |

### Limit reset periods

Different limits reset on different schedules:

- Per-second limits reset continuously
- Per-minute limits reset every 60 seconds
- Daily limits reset at midnight UTC
- Monthly limits reset on your billing cycle date

## Managing account limits

### Monitoring usage patterns

To stay within limits:

1. Check the limits page regularly
2. Set up alerts for approaching thresholds
3. Monitor usage trends over time
4. Identify peak usage periods

### Optimizing usage

When approaching limits:

1. Review application efficiency - Optimize message frequency and size
2. Implement batching - Group multiple small messages together
3. Use appropriate channels - Avoid unnecessary channel proliferation
4. Optimize connection patterns - Minimize connection churn

### Requesting limit increases

If you need higher limits:

1. Contact [Ably support](mailto:support@ably.com) with your requirements
2. Provide details about your use case and expected growth
3. Specify which limits need adjustment
4. Consider upgrading to a higher-tier plan

## Limit-related best practices

### Proactive monitoring

- Check limits regularly, especially during development
- Set up monitoring alerts before reaching 80% of limits
- Understand which limits apply to your specific use case
- Plan for growth by monitoring usage trends

### Application design

- Design applications to handle rate limiting gracefully
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Use appropriate message sizes and frequencies
- Consider limit implications during architecture planning

### Development and testing

- Use separate development/staging apps to avoid impacting production limits
- Test applications under load to understand limit requirements
- Design applications to degrade gracefully when limits are reached
- Implement client-side rate limiting where appropriate

### Emergency procedures

- Have a plan for when limits are reached unexpectedly
- Know how to quickly contact support for emergency limit increases
- Implement application-level safeguards against runaway usage
- Monitor for unusual usage spikes that might indicate issues

## Common limit scenarios

### Approaching connection limits

When nearing connection limits:

1. Review connection lifecycle management
2. Implement connection pooling where possible
3. Optimize connection reuse patterns
4. Consider upgrading your plan

### Message rate limit issues

When hitting message rate limits:

1. Implement message batching strategies
2. Review message frequency requirements
3. Consider using presence events for state rather than messages
4. Optimize message payload sizes

### Channel proliferation

When approaching channel limits:

1. Review channel naming and organization strategies
2. Implement channel cleanup for unused channels
3. Consider using channel namespaces more effectively
4. Optimize channel lifecycle management

Account limits are designed to ensure reliable service delivery. Understanding and monitoring these limits helps you build robust, scalable applications on the Ably platform.
