Security and encryption are front of mind and any realtime platform will have robust security built into their design and delivery. A good general checklist for security is:

* TLS connection to ensure all "data in transit are encrypted":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000045208
* "Token-based authentication":/core-features/authentication?utm_source={{COMPANY_ID_0}}_v_{{COMPANY_ID_1}}&utm_medium=compare_pages (including "JWT":https://jwt.io support), which ensures your private key is never shared and instead a short-lived token is used to authenticate
* Configurable "private key permissions":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030502 to restrict "channels/topics":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030057 or operations
* "Encrypted message payloads":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000029535 to enhance security and privacy of all messages
