Ably Pub/Sub enables you to implement the publish-subscribe (pub-sub) pattern. Any number of publishers can send messages to a channel, and any number of subscribers can receive those messages. Publishers and subscribers are completely decoupled from one another.

"Channels":/channels are used to separate messages into different topics. "Messages":/messages contain the data that a client is communicating, such as the contents of an individual chat message, or an event that has occurred, such as updated financial information. Whilst billions of messages may be delivered by Ably, clients receive only the messages on the channels they subscribe to.

To get started with sending and receiving messages, all you need to do is:

* "Use a channel":#use
* "Subscribe to the channel":#subscribe
* "Publish messages to the channel":#publish

h2(#use). Use a channel

Channels are used to separate your message traffic into different topics, and are identified by a unique name. Clients create or retrieve a channel and can then subscribe to them, and send messages to them.

Use the "@get()@":/api/realtime-sdk/channels#get method to create or retrieve a channel instance:

```[realtime_javascript]
const channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
```

```[realtime_nodejs]
const channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
```

```[realtime_java]
Channel channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
```

```[realtime_csharp]
IRealtimeChannel channel = realtime.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}"); realtime
```

```[realtime_ruby]
channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}') realtime
```

```[realtime_python]
channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
```

```[realtime_objc]
ARTRealtimeChannel *channel = [realtime.channels get:@"{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}"];
```

```[realtime_swift]
let channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
```

```[realtime_flutter]
final channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
```

```[realtime_go]
channel := realtime.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
```

```[rest_javascript]
const channel = rest.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
```

```[rest_nodejs]
const channel = rest.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
```

```[rest_java]
Channel channel = rest.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
```

```[rest_csharp]
Channel channel = rest.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}"); rest
```

```[rest_ruby]
channel = rest.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}') rest
```

```[rest_python]
channel = rest.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
```

```[rest_php]
$channel = $rest->channels->get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
```

```[rest_objc]
ARTRestChannel *channel = [realtime.channels get:@"{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}"];
```

```[rest_swift]
let channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
```

```[rest_flutter]
final channel = rest.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
```

```[rest_go]
channel := rest.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
```

h2(#subscribe). Subscribe to a channel

Clients subscribe to a channel to receive the messages published to it. Clients can subscribe to all messages, or only messages identified by specific names.

Subscribing is an operation that is only available to the realtime interface of Pub/Sub SDKs. This is because it requires establishing a persistent "connection":/connect to Ably in order to receive messages in realtime.

Use the "@subscribe()@":/api/realtime-sdk/channels#subscribe method on a channel to receive any messages that are published to it.

The following is an example of subscribing to all messages on a channel:

```[realtime_javascript]
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime('{{API_KEY}}');
const channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
await channel.subscribe((message) => {
  alert('Received: ' + message.data);
});
```

```[realtime_nodejs]
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime('{{API_KEY}}');
const channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
await channel.subscribe((message) => {
  console.log("Received: " + message.data);
});
```

```[realtime_ruby]
  realtime = Ably::Realtime.new('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  channel.subscribe do |message|
    puts "Received: #{message.data}"
  end
```

```[realtime_python]
  realtime = AblyRealtime('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  def listener(message):
    print('Received ' + message.data)
  await channel.subscribe(listener)
```

```[realtime_java]
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime("{{API_KEY}}");
  Channel channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
  channel.subscribe(new MessageListener() {
    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
      System.out.println("New messages arrived. " + message.name);
    }
  });
```

```[realtime_csharp]
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime("{{API_KEY}}");
  IRealtimeChannel channel = realtime.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
  channel.Subscribe(message => {
    Console.WriteLine($"Message: {message.Name}:{message.Data} received");
  });
```

```[realtime_objc]
ARTRealtime *realtime = [[ARTRealtime alloc] initWithKey:@"{{API_KEY}}"];
ARTRealtimeChannel *channel = [realtime.channels get:@"{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}"];
[channel subscribe:^(ARTMessage *message) {
    NSLog(@"Received: %@", message.data);
}];
```

```[realtime_swift]
let realtime = ARTRealtime(key: "{{API_KEY}}")
let channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
channel.subscribe { message in
    print("Received: \(message.data)")
}
```

```[realtime_flutter]
  final realtime = ably.Realtime(key: '{{API_KEY}}');
  final channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
  final channelMessageSubscription = channel
    .subscribe()
    .listen((ably.Message message) {
      print('Received: ${message.data}');
    }
  );
```

```[realtime_go]
realtime, err := ably.NewRealtime(
  ably.WithKey("{{API_KEY}}"))
channel := realtime.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}

_, err = channel.SubscribeAll(context.Background(), func(msg *ably.Message) {
  fmt.Printf("Received: '%v'\n", msg.Data)
})
```

The following is an example of only subscribing to messages with a specific name:

```[realtime_javascript]
await channel.subscribe('myEvent', (message) => {
  console.log('message received for event ' + message.name);
  console.log('message data:' + message.data);
});
```

```[realtime_nodejs]
await channel.subscribe('myEvent', (message) => {
  console.log('message received for event ' + message.name);
  console.log('message data:' + message.data);
});
```

```[realtime_java]
channel.subscribe("myEvent", new MessageListener() {
  @Override
  public void onMessage(Message message) {
    System.out.println("Message received: " + message.data);
  }
});
```

```[realtime_csharp]
channel.Subscribe("myEvent", message =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"message received for event {message.Name}");
    Console.WriteLine($"message data: {message.Data}");
});
```

```[realtime_ruby]
channel.subscribe('myEvent') do |message|
  puts "message received for event #{message.name}"
  puts "message data: #{message.data}"
end
```

```[realtime_python]
  realtime = AblyRealtime('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  def listener(message):
    print(f'Message received for {message.name}: {message.data}')
  await channel.subscribe('myEvent', listener)
```

```[realtime_swift]
channel.subscribe("myEvent") { message in
    print("message received for event \(message.name)")
    print("message data: \(message.data)")
}
```

```[realtime_objc]
[channel subscribe:@"myEvent" callback:^(ARTMessage *message) {
    NSLog(@"message received for event %@", message.name);
    NSLog(@"message data: %@", message.data);
}];
```

```[realtime_flutter]
final channelMessageSubscription = channel
  .subscribe(name: 'myEvent')
  .listen((ably.Message message) {
    print('message received for event ${message.name}');
    print('message data: ${message.data}');
  }
);
```

```[realtime_go]
_, err = channel.Subscribe(context.Background(), "myEvent", func(msg *ably.Message) {
  fmt.Printf("message received for event: '%v'\n", msg.Name)
  fmt.Printf("message data: '%v'\n", msg.Data)
})
```

h2(#publish). Publish a message

Publishing messages to a channel is how clients communicate with one another. Any subscribers will receive published messages as long as they are subscribed and have the @subscribe@ "capability":/auth/capabilities for that channel.

Publishing is an operation available to the realtime and REST interfaces of Pub/Sub SDKs. REST publishing is more efficient if you don't need to establish a persistent "connection":/connect to Ably, such as to subscribe to messages. For example, if you have a server publishing messages to channels that doesn't need to receive any updates from them.

Use the "@publish()@":/api/realtime-sdk/channels#publish method to send messages to a channel.


```[realtime_javascript]
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime('{{API_KEY}}');
const channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
await channel.publish('example', 'message data');
```

```[realtime_nodejs]
const realtime = new Ably.Realtime('{{API_KEY}}');
const channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
await channel.publish('example', 'message data');
```

```[realtime_ruby]
  realtime = Ably::Realtime.new('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  channel.publish 'example', 'message data'
```

```[realtime_python]
  # Python realtime currently utilizes a REST publish
  realtime = AblyRealtime('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  await channel.publish('example', 'message data')
```

```[realtime_java]
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime("{{API_KEY}}");
  Channel channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
  channel.publish("example", "message data");
```

```[realtime_csharp]
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime("{{API_KEY}}");
  IRealtimeChannel channel = realtime.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
  channel.Publish("example", "message data");
```

```[realtime_objc]
ARTRealtime *realtime = [[ARTRealtime alloc] initWithKey:@"{{API_KEY}}"];
ARTRealtimeChannel *channel = [realtime.channels get:@"{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}"];
[channel publish:@"example" data:@"message data"];
```

```[realtime_swift]
let realtime = ARTRealtime(key: "{{API_KEY}}")
let channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
channel.publish("example", data: "message data")
```

```[realtime_flutter]
  final realtime = ably.Realtime(key: '{{API_KEY}}');
  final channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
  await channel.publish(name: 'example', data: 'message data');
```

```[realtime_go]
realtime, err := ably.NewRealtime(
    ably.WithKey("{{API_KEY}}"))
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Error creating Ably client: %v", err)
}
channel := realtime.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
channel.Publish(context.Background(), "example", "message data")
```

```[rest_javascript]
const rest = new Ably.Rest('{{API_KEY}}');
const channel = rest.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
await channel.publish('example', 'message data');
```

```[rest_nodejs]
const rest = new Ably.Rest('{{API_KEY}}');
const channel = rest.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
await channel.publish('example', 'message data');
```

```[rest_ruby]
  rest = Ably::Rest.new('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = rest.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  channel.publish 'example', 'message data'
```

```[rest_python]
  rest = AblyRest('{{API_KEY}}')
  channel = rest.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  await channel.publish(u'example', u'message data')
```

```[rest_php]
  $rest = new Ably\AblyRest('{{API_KEY}}');
  $channel = $rest->channels->get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
  $channel->publish('example', 'message data');
```

```[rest_java]
  AblyRest rest = new AblyRest("{{API_KEY}}");
  Channel channel = rest.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
  channel.publish("example", "message data");
```

```[rest_csharp]
  AblyRest rest = new AblyRest("{{API_KEY}}");
  var channel = rest.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
  await channel.PublishAsync("example", "message data");
```

```[rest_objc]
  ARTRest *rest = [[ARTRest alloc] initWithKey:@"{{API_KEY}}"];
  ARTRestChannel *channel = [rest.channels get:@"{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}"];
  [channel publish:@"example" data:@"message data"];
```

```[rest_swift]
  let rest = ARTRest(key: "{{API_KEY}}")
  let channel = rest.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
  channel.publish("example", data: "message data")
