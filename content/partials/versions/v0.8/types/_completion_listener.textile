A <span lang="java">@io.ably.lib.realtime.CompletionListener@</span> is an interface allowing a client to be notified of the outcome of an asynchronous operation.

```[java]
  public interface CompletionListener {
    // Called when the associated operation completes successfully,
    public void onSuccess();

    // Called when the associated operation completes with an error.
    public void onError(ErrorInfo reason);
  }
```
