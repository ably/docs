Ably enables you to build live chat experiences into your applications. Use Ably SDKs to implement various chat features that work at any scale. Whether you're building a large-scale live streaming chat platform or supporting a 1:1 support chat. Some of the features possible include:

- "Channels and Messages":/chat/channels := create or join channels of any size, for example a large scale live streaming chat, a company group chat, or a 1:1 chat. These conversations are the core foundations that enable you to then send and receive messages, as well as reply directly to messages among other functionalities.
- "Replies and Threads":/chat/replies := react to messages by replying directly to them, or creating a thread to direct the chat participants specifically to that thread in the conversation.
- "Participant activity":/chat/participant-activity := display the status of chat participants such as are they currently online or offline by monitoring when they actively entered and left the conversation. If the user is online, display when they were last seen as active within the chat platform.
- "Reactions":/chat/reactions := react to previously sent messages, for example giving a heart to a friend's message, or giving a thumbs up for a colleague's proposal.
- "Moderation":/chat/moderation := limit user's ability to post messages within a given timeframe with slow mode.
- "Typing indicators":/chat/typing := indicate whether a chat participant is currently typing within the specific conversation.

h2(#sdk). Ably SDK

The Ably Javascript SDK, with full TypeScript support, enables you to easily add realtime chat features to an existing application, or build a new application from scratch. The SDK enables you to build out your chat application with features such as those found listed above.

Just as with building any realtime application with Ably, you'll need  "Authentication":/auth, of which there are two types "basic authentication":/auth/basic for your backend server and "token authentication":/auth/token to generate tokens for your chat participant clients. "Connection management":/connect := enables you to manage the connections for your clients, ensuring they connect before subscribing to channels for example.

For further instructions on installing and configuring the SDK, please refer to the "SDK setup":/getting-started/setup documentation guide.
