# Error 40400: Resource not found

## What Happened

The system could not find the resource you requested - typically an API key component, application, rule, device, or other identifier doesn't exist or is no longer available.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40400 | 404 | Client Error (Resource) | No - resource must exist first |

## Quick Fix

- Double-check your API key for typos - especially missing or extra characters
- Verify you're using the correct environment (production vs sandbox)
- Confirm the resource exists in your [Ably dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard)

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "No application found with id {appId}"
- "No such key {keyId}"
- "invalid key parameter"
- "Device with Id '{deviceId}' is not found"
- "rule {ruleId} not found"
- "Unable to locate subscription"
- "No link to the first/current page of results"
- "Message not found"
- "Could not find path: {path}"
- Various resource-specific "not found" messages

## Common Causes

<!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40400-analysis.md lines 139-162 and knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40400-knowledge.md lines 143-148 -->

1. **Invalid API key components** (Most common)
   - Missing characters from the app ID (first part before the dot)
   - Missing characters from the key ID (part between dot and colon)
   - Incorrect API key format (missing colon separator)
   - Using a deleted or regenerated key

2. **Wrong environment or region**
   - Using production key in sandbox environment
   - Using sandbox key in production
   - Incorrect regional endpoint

3. **Resource has been deleted**
   - API key was regenerated or deleted
   - Push device registration removed
   - Integration rule deleted
   - Application removed

4. **Pagination issues**
   - Missing or malformed pagination links
   - Empty result sets
   - Manually constructed pagination URLs

5. **System initialization problems**
   - Required monitors not available
   - Configuration resources missing
   - Dependencies not initialized

## Resolution Steps

<!-- Source: Knowledge file guidance from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40400-knowledge.md lines 62-67 with authentication-specific guidance from editorial notes https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/src/prompts/errors/editorial-notes.md lines 54-60 -->

1. **Verify your API key structure**
   - API keys have the format: `appId.keyId:keySecret`
   - Example: `xVLyHw.Ke5A1w:dTfJtg-OP2L8B...`
   - The app ID is before the first dot (`xVLyHw`)
   - The key ID is between the dot and colon (`Ke5A1w`)
   - Ensure no characters are missing from any part

2. **Check in your Ably dashboard**
   - Log into [https://ably.com/dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard)
   - Navigate to your app
   - Go to the "API Keys" tab
   - Copy the complete key including all three parts
   - Verify you're in the correct environment (production/sandbox)

3. **For device registration errors**
   - Confirm the device ID exists in Push Notifications â†’ Devices
   - Check if the device was recently unregistered
   - Ensure the device registration hasn't expired

4. **For pagination errors**
   - Use the pagination links provided in API responses
   - Don't manually construct pagination URLs
   - Check if the result set contains any items

5. **For integration rule errors**
   - Navigate to Integrations in your dashboard
   - Verify the rule ID exists and is active
   - Check if the rule was recently modified or deleted

## Automatic Handling

<!-- Source: Analysis finding from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40400-analysis.md lines 209-212 regarding error being permanent -->

This is a client error that will not be automatically retried. The resource must exist before the operation can succeed. SDKs will not attempt to recover from this error as it indicates a permanent issue with the request.

## Prevention

<!-- Source: Best practices from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40400-knowledge.md lines 71-76 -->

- Store API keys in environment variables to avoid typos
- Implement proper error handling for 404 responses
- Validate resource IDs before making API calls
- Use the Ably dashboard to manage and verify resources
- Keep track of resource deletions and updates
- Test API keys after regeneration
