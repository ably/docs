# Error 50310: Edge service unavailable

## What Happened

Ably's edge proxy service received a service unavailable response from the Ably platform backend.

## Quick Reference

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 50310 | 503 | Server Error (Edge Proxy) | Yes - temporary platform issue |

## Quick Fix

- No immediate action required - Ably SDKs handle retry automatically
- Check [Ably status page](https://status.ably.com) if persistent
- The platform will typically recover within minutes

## Error Messages

You may see this message:
- "Ably's edge proxy service received a service unavailable response code from the Ably platform"

## Common Causes

1. **Temporary platform unavailability** (most common)
   - Brief service disruption
   - Platform overload during traffic spikes
   - Automatic recovery expected
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50310-analysis.md lines 18-20 -->

2. **Backend service issues**
   - Core Ably services experiencing availability problems
   - Usually resolved quickly by automatic failover
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50310-knowledge.md lines 26-27 -->

3. **Network communication issues**
   - Temporary network problems between CloudFront edge and Ably platform
   - Often transient and self-resolving
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50310-knowledge.md line 28 -->

4. **Planned maintenance**
   - Scheduled platform updates
   - Check status page for maintenance windows
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50310-knowledge.md line 29 -->

## Resolution Steps

1. **For transient errors (most cases)**
   - Ably SDKs automatically retry with appropriate backoff
   - No action required unless persistent
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for automatic recovery
   <!-- Source: Based on standard Ably SDK behavior for 5xx errors per Error Code Documentation Writing Guide -->

2. **For persistent errors (>2 minutes)**
   - Check https://status.ably.com for platform status
   - Look for any reported incidents or maintenance
   - Subscribe to status updates if issue is ongoing
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50310-knowledge.md line 84 -->

3. **If during high-volume operations**
   - Consider reducing request rate temporarily
   - Implement client-side throttling if pushing large volumes
   - Spread load over time if possible
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/50310-knowledge.md lines 66-68, 85 -->

4. **Monitor and verify recovery**
   ```javascript
   ably.connection.on('connected', () => {
     console.log('Successfully reconnected to Ably');
   });
   
   ably.connection.on('failed', (stateChange) => {
     console.error('Connection failed:', stateChange.reason);
     // Only take action if failure persists
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Standard connection monitoring pattern from Ably documentation -->

## Automatic Handling

Ably SDKs automatically retry 503 errors with exponential backoff. The SDK will:
- Retry the request with increasing delays
- Maintain connection state during retries
- Resume normal operation once platform recovers
- No manual intervention needed for transient issues

## Prevention

While 503 errors typically indicate platform-side issues beyond your control:
- Implement graceful degradation in your application
- Cache critical data locally when possible
- Monitor connection state to provide user feedback
- Consider implementing offline-first patterns for critical features

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Specific documentation about CloudFront edge proxy architecture and error codes
- Impact: Users may not understand the difference between edge proxy errors and direct platform errors
- Recommendation: Add dedicated edge proxy documentation explaining the infrastructure layer
- Severity: Low - the current error handling guidance is sufficient for users
-->
