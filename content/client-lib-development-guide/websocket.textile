h2. Overview

The Ably Realtime service supports client connections over multiple transports. The WebSocket transport is the primary
transport for efficient connection by browser clients that are websocket-capable, and any other client environment that
offers direct TCP socket access.

The WebSocket transport transmits Protocol Messages in a single WebSocket data frame. In the binary transport, these
are sent as binary data frames, with the Protocol Message being encoded with the standard thrift binary encoding.
In the text transport these are sent as text data frames containing JSON-encoded ProtocolMessage objects. The protocol
definition specifies the content and interpretation of the various protocol messages.

This section defines details that are transport-specific, covering:

* connection;
* disconnection;
* WebSocket protocol draft support.

h2. Connection

Establishment of a WebSocket transport requires that the client makes a WebSocket or secure WebSocket connection to the
Ably WebSocket host (realtime.ably.io or one of the ws fallback hosts). The client library must allow the client to
specify a non-default host, at least to be able to connect to the staging environment at staging-realtime.ably.io.

TLS connections are supported only for accounts that have TLS enabled. Certain apps may be configured to require TLS
connections and will reject non-TLS connections.

The connection URI must be a valid WebSocket URI as specified in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-3 with an
empty path component. The URI must include a valid set of authorisation params and a valid set of connection params,
each as specified below.

h3. Authorisation params

Authorisation params must be either basic authorisation params or token authorisation params.

Basic auth params:

key_id (mandatory)
key_value (mandatory)

The key_id and key_value are obtained from the library initialisation options.

Token auth params:

access_token (mandatory)

If the library has been initialised with a clientId then the authorisation params must include a "client_id" param with
the clientId value. In the case of token auth, the token must either have been issued against that clientId or against
the wildcard clientId.

h3. Connection params

Connection params cover protocol mode and recovery mode.

Protocol mode is specified with the optional "binary" param:

binary (optional); possible values "true", "false"; default if omitted is "true".

The connection recovery mode is one of "clean", "resume" or "recover". Clean mode is the default, and is assumed if no
connection params are specified.

Resume or recover mode are specified by including a "resume" or "recover" param respectively. In each case the value of
that param is the connectionId string of the connection that is being recovered.

Resume and recover mode also require a "connection_serial" param to be specified whose value is the (decimal
representation of the) serial number of the last message received.

h3. Failed connections

In the event of a connection failure, the service may respond in two ways.

First, the service may simply refuse the connection and there will be no handshake. The library must report this to the
client as a 401 Unauthorized error with no further error information.

Alternatively, the service may accept the WebSocket connection and complete the handshake, and then send an ERROR
Protocol Message with further error information, followed by a normal close of the WebSocket connection. In this case
the library must report that error information as the reason for connection failure to the client.

At any time after a successful connection, the service may initiate termination of the connection by sending an ERROR
message; this might occur for example if the credentials have been revoked, or the account has breached a hard
connection limit. If a connection ERROR message is received, the error information must be passed to the client as the
failure reason.

h2. Disconnection

Disconnection of the transport, in the case that the client wishes to be able to recover connection state, simply
requires the client to perform a normal close on the WebSocket.

Closing the connection, resulting in disposal of connection state, is achieved by sending a DISCONNECT message. The
client can then perform a normal close on the WebSocket.

Abnormal termination for whatever reason (a transition to the failed connection state) again just requires a normal
close of the WebSocket.

WebSocket close events that are initiated by the remote end are handled as follows.

A normal close, if the client end had already initiated an explicit DISCONNECT, are reported to the client as a
transition to the closed state.

Any other normal close, or a close with one of the following codes:

* GOING_AWAY (1001)
* ABNORMAL_CLOSE (1006)

is reported to the client as a transition to the disconnected or the suspended state,
depending on whether or not the client has exceeded the suspended timeout.

Any close with any of the following codes:

* CLOSE_PROTOCOL_ERROR (1002)
* REFUSE (1003)
* NO_UTF8 (1007)
* POLICY_VALIDATION (1008)
* TOOBIG (1009)
* EXTENSION (1010)
* UNEXPECTED_CONDITION (1011)
* TLS_ERROR (1015)

is reported as a transition to the failed state. The reason code is derived from the reported
WebSocket reason code as follows:

* REFUSE, POLICY_VALIDATION : 40100;
* TOOBIG : 40000;
* any other code : 80000.

h2. WebSocket protocol draft support

Clients must use the RFC 6455 WebSocket protocol. Browsers that support earlier drafts are accommodated by the service
based on specific knowledge of the state of those browser's conformance to a particular draft; the Ably service does
attempt to comply with any draft other than the RFC.
