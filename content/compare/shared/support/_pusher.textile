h5(#support-fanout). Pusher's support

A breakdown of what we found of Pusher’s support offering:

* Ticket-based support with no live chat - most software providers today offer some sort of live chat or support and it’s often a quick two minute chat can point you to the right bit of documentation, saving you time searching yourself
* The "help centre":https://support.pusher.com/hc/en-us is solid with the expected FAQ style
* Most of the pricing tiers have target response times:
** Startup and pro pricing: target response within 72 hours
** Business and premium: target responses within 48 hours
** Enterprise: standard for the industry but quite the bump compared to Pusher’s other tiers with 24/7 support, phone support, and a dedicated Slack Channel
