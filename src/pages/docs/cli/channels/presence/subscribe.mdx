Use the `ably channels presence subscribe` command to subscribe to presence events on a channel and monitor who enters, leaves, or updates their presence data.

Use another terminal instance and the [`ably channels presence enter`](/docs/cli/channels/presence/enter) command to see a client join the presence set and emit an enter event.

## Arguments

Pass the following argument to the `ably channels presence subscribe` command:

### `<channel>` <a id="channel"/>

The channel name to subscribe to presence events for, for example: `example-channel`.

## Flags

You can optionally pass the following flag to the `ably channels presence subscribe` command:

### `--duration | -D` <a id="duration"/>

Automatically exit after the given number of seconds. Set to `0` to run indefinitely. The default is `0`.

## Global flags

The following global flags are supported using the `ably channels presence subscribe` command:

* [`--token`](/docs/cli#token)
* [`--json`](/docs/cli#json)
* [`--pretty-json`](/docs/cli#pretty-json)
* [`--api-key`](/docs/cli#api-key)

## Output

When you subscribe to the presence set of a channel using the CLI, you'll see a list of members currently present.

The actions associated with each event are:

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Enter | A client has entered the presence set. |
| Update | A client has updated their presence data. |
| Leave | A client has left the presence set. |
| Present | A client is currently present. This is used to list the members currently in the presence set when a client first joins. |
