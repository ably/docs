[Tisane](https://tisane.ai/) is a powerful Natural Language Understanding (NLU) platform that can be used to moderate content in chat rooms.

The Tisane rule is a rule applied to chat rooms in Ably Chat which enables you to use Tisane's text moderation capabilities to detect and handle inappropriate content before it is published to other users.

## Integration setup <a id="setup"/>

Configure the integration rule in your [Ably dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/integrations) or using the [Control API](/docs/account/control-api).

The following are the fields specific to Tisane configuration:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Tisane API key | The API key for your Tisane account. |
| Thresholds | A map of [text moderation categories](https://docs.tisane.ai/apis/tisane-api-response-guide#supported-types) to severity levels (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `extreme`). When moderating text, any message deemed to be at or above a specified threshold will be rejected and not published to the chat room. |
| Default Language | The language to use for content analysis. |
| Model URL (optional) | A custom URL if using a custom moderation model. |

For additional configuration options shared across all before-publish moderation rules, see the [common configuration fields](/docs/chat/moderation#common-config).

## Handling rejections <a id="rejections"/>

If a message fails moderation the message will not be published and the publish request will be rejected.

Moderation rejections will use error code `42213`.
