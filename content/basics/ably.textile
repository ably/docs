title: What is Ably
meta_description: "A brief introduction to Ably and its features."
---

Ably’s realtime platform enables data to be streamed between Internet connected systems in milliseconds through our Realtime or REST interfaces. Built on the "Four Pillars of Dependability":#infrastructure Ably provides reliable performance available when needed.

h2(#what). What can you build with Ably?

Ably is used across a variety of industries to provide scalable:

* Live updates
* Chat applications
* Virtual events
* Multi-user virtual spaces and applications
* And much more

Below we will cover some of the different APIs and features Ably provides which will give you a deeper insight into what can be done with Ably. There's also the "How to use Ably page":/basics/use-ably which will go over the basics of connecting with Ably.

Alternatively take a look at our "Use cases and solutions":https://ably.com/solutions page for specific example use cases.

h2(#about). About the APIs

Ably supports both realtime and REST interfaces. The "Realtime library":/basics/use-ably#realtime-interface establishes a WebSocket connection allowing realtime messages to be efficently sent both to and from the Ably. The "REST library":/basics/use-ably#rest-interface communicates using the HTTP protocol for all operations and is effectively stateless.

There are a number of "Ably SDKs":https://ably.com/download in different languages to match your needs.

Some of the key features are: 

* "PubSub with channels":#pubsub
* "Presence and occupancy":#presence-and-occupancy
* "Message storage and history":#message-storage-and-history
* "Push Notifications":#push-notifications

h3(#pubsub). PubSub with Channels

Ably uses the Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) architectural pattern to allow any number of publishers to publish data and any number of subscribers to subscribe to a source of data. This works hand in hand with Ably's concept of "channels". Channels are used to aggregate all data into a single location, allowing publishers to publish to just one location and subscribers to subscribe to just one location.

Read more in our "Pub/Sub section":/channels/.

h3(#presence-and-occupancy). Presence and Occupancy

Ably’s presence feature allows clients or devices to announce their presence on a channel. Other devices or services may then subscribe to these presence events (such as entering, updating their state, or leaving the channel). You can also request a list of clients or devices that are online/offline on a channel at a particular point in time via the REST API.

Occupancy provides metrics about the clients attached to a channel, including a count of the number of clients attached, the number of publishers and subscribers, the number of presence members, and the number of presence publishers and subscribers.

Read more in our "Presence and occupancy section":/presence-occupancy/.

h3(#message-storage-and-history). Message storage and History

Ably's Message storage and History allows messages to be accessed after initially being sent. You can persist the last message sent using the rewind channel option or enable persistence of all messages for 24 hours for the free tier or 72 hours for paid tiers. These messages can be retrieved using the History API. You can also persist messages to external storage services such as AWS through the use of "Ably Integrations":/integrations/.

By default messages are only stored for two minutes on Ably’s servers, these messages can be retrieved in the event of a lost connection using the History API.

Read more in our "Message storage and history section":/storage-history/.

h3(#push-notifications). Push Notifications

Ably's Push Notifications feature allows messages to be pushed to subscribers without needing a device to maintain a connection to Ably. Push Notifications are commonly used to display visual notifications to users or launch background processes  for apps in a battery-efficient manner.

Read more in our "Push Notifications section":/push/.

h2(#infrastructure). About the Infrastructure

To ensure unrivaled realtime messaging and data streaming performance, availability, and reliability the Ably Global Network has 7 geographically-distributed core routing datacenters and 307 edge acceleration points-of-presence(PoPs).

Building on the Global Network Ably focuses on a seamless experience, that's why Ably's infrastructure is built around the "Four Pillars of Dependability":https://ably.com/four-pillars-of-dependability.

h3(#performance). Performance

By providing consistently minimized latency and bandwidth requirements developers know what to expect and to design towards. If you know the boundaries Ably will always operate within, you can design, build, and scale features around them, confident they’ll perform as expected under various conditions.

h3(#integrity). Integrity

Knowing that many apps rely on a strict sequence of messages that depend on each other, Ably is designed to maintain the end-to-end integrity of messages. This allows for simplified app architecture as you don't need to develop around missed, unordered, or duplicated messages. Integrity is guaranteed at scale thanks to Ably's modern system architecture.

h3(#reliability). Reliability

Being able to trust your provider is one of the most important aspects of choosing a provider. Ably’s ensures this trust with a platform designed with redundancy at a regional and global level based on statistical risks of failure, continuing even in the face of multiple infrastructure failures.

h3(#availability). Availability

Going hand in hand with reliability Ably is designed to be elastic and highly-available to even the most stringent and demanding realtime requirements. Using mathematically grounded design means Ably can transparently share the operating boundaries we monitor to ensure capacity and therefore availability, helping you understand the type of scale and elasticity capable with Ably.
