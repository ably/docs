h2(#security). How secure is the platform and the way it does things?

Security and encryption are front of mind and any realtime platform will have robust security built into their design and delivery. A good general checklist for security is:

* TLS connection to ensure all "data in transit are encrypted":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000045208-are-messages-sent-to-and-received-from-ably-sent-security-using-tls
* "Token-based authentication":https://www.ably.io/documentation/core-features/authentication (including "JWT":https://jwt.io support), which ensures your private key is never shared and instead a short-lived token is used to authenticate
* Configurable "private key permissions":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030502-setting-up-and-managing-api-keys to restrict "channels/topics":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030057-what-are-channel-rules-and-how-can-i-use-them-in-my-app or operations
* "Encrypted message payloads":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000029535-cross-platform-symmetrical-encryption-offered-by-the-libraries to enhance security and privacy of all messages
