title: Publish & Subscribe Tutorial

The Ably Realtime service organises the message traffic within applications into named channels. Channels are the “unit” of message distribution; clients attach to any number of channels to subscribe to messages, and every message published to a channel is broadcasted to all subscribers. This scalable and resilient messaging pattern is commonly called pub/sub.

As you can publish a message to any channel, channels provide a means for you to filter data by topic or enforce access control for your subscribers. Only subscribers for those channesl will receive those messages.

Messages published can contain string, JSON object, JSON array or binary data payloads.

"Publishing and subscribing for messages on channels with our channel API":/realtime/channels-messages is trivial. Let's get started.

h2. Step 2 - Install Ably

blang[javascript].
  To start using Ably in your web app, you first need to include the Ably library. We recommend that you include the latest client library from our CDN using a simple @<script>@ tag. The client library must be instanced with the API key you copied in Step 1. Note in production we recommend you always use the "token authentication scheme":/general/authentication#token-authentication for browser clients, however in this example we use an API key for simplicity.

  Include the code below just before your closing your HTML @</html>@ tag.

  ```[javascript]
    <!-- Include the latest Ably Library  -->
    <script src="//cdn.ably.io/lib/ably-0.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Instance the Ably library  -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var realtime = new Ably.Realtime(apiKey);
    </script>
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/843128d

blang[nodejs].
  To start using Ably you first need to install the NPM module. The NPM module can be installed as follows:

  ```[sh]
    npm install ably
  ```

  The client library must be instanced with the API key you copied in Step 1. API keys are a suitable authentication scheme for your own servers, however clients running on insecure devices should always use the "token authentication scheme":/general/authentication#token-authentication instead. In this example, we use an API key for simplicity.

  ```[nodejs]
    var Ably = require("ably");
    var realtime = new Ably.Realtime({ key: apiKey });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/f8a9f4a

blang[ruby].
  To start using Ably you first need to install the Ably RubyGem. The RubyGem can be installed as follows:

  ```[sh]
    gem install ably
  ```

  Or if using bundler, simply add the following to your Gemfile and run @bundle install@:

  ```[ruby]
    gem 'ably'
  ```

  The client library must be instanced with the API key you copied in Step 1. API keys are a suitable authentication scheme for your own servers, however clients running on insecure devices should always use the "token authentication scheme":/general/authentication#token-authentication instead. In this example, we use an API key for simplicity.

  The Ruby realtime library uses "EventMachine":https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine to run the client library within an event loop. Add the following to a file named @example.rb@ to instance the Ably library inside an EventMachine reactor:

  ```[ruby]
    require 'ably'
    EventMachine.run do
      ably = Ably::Realtime.new(key: api_key)
    end
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/0ec2c7e

h2. Step 3 - Subscribe to messages

Now that the library is installed, you can subscribe to messages published on channels. Every app can have an arbitrary number of channels that should be used to filter the messages received by subscribing clients. For example, if building a news feed, you may want one channel for politics named "politics", and another for sport named "sport". A user interested in "sport" can subscribe to the "sport" channel to receive updates. If that user is not subscribed to the "politics" channel, then "politics" updates will not be delivered to that user.

blang[javascript].
  ```[javascript]
    var channel = realtime.channels.get("sport");
    channel.subscribe(function(msg) {
      alert("Received: " + JSON.stringify(msg.data));
    });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/de53537

blang[nodejs].
  ```[nodejs]
    var channel = realtime.channels.get("sport");
    channel.subscribe(function(msg) {
      console.log("Received: " + JSON.stringify(msg.data));
    });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/334016a

blang[ruby].
  ```[ruby]
    channel = ably.channels.get('sport')
    channel.subscribe do |msg|
      puts "Received: #{msg.data}"
    end
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/75becbf

h2. Step 4 - Publishing a message

Publishing a message on a channel ensures that any number of subscribers on that channel receive the message in real time. To publish a message on the "sports" channel we simply call the publish method on the channel, specify an optional message event name, and provide the payload as the second argument.

blang[javascript].
  ```[javascript]
    var channel = realtime.channels.get("sport");
    channel.publish("update", { "team": "Man United" });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/140583e

blang[nodejs].
  ```[nodejs]
    var channel = realtime.channels.get("sport");
    channel.publish("update", { "team": "Man United" });
  ```

  "See this step in Github":https://github.com/ably/tutorials/commit/f831895

blang[ruby].
  ```[ruby]
    channel = ably.channels.get('sport')
    channel.publish 'update', 'team' => 'Man United'
  ```

We're done, it's that simple. We have now shown you how to subscribe to messages on a channel, and then publish messages on a channel. To see this in action, try out the live demo below.
