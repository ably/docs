<Code>
```shell
ably rooms reactions subscribe <room> [flags]
```
</Code>

Use the `ably rooms reactions subscribe` command to subscribe to reactions in a chat room. Room reactions are not tied to a specific message, and are for users to show their sentiment as to what is happening within the room.

Use another terminal instance and the [`ably rooms reactions send`](/docs/cli/rooms/reactions/send) command to send reactions that will be received by this subscription.

## Arguments

### `<room>` <a id="room"/>

The room to subscribe to reactions in, for example: `example-room`.

## Global flags

The following global flags are supported using the `ably rooms reactions subscribe` command:

* [`--token`](/docs/cli#token)
* [`--json`](/docs/cli#json)
* [`--pretty-json`](/docs/cli#pretty-json)
* [`--api-key`](/docs/cli#api-key)
* [`--access-token`](/docs/cli#access-token)

* [`--env`](/docs/cli#env)
* [`--host`](/docs/cli#host)

## Examples
