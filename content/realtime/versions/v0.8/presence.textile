Presence enables clients to be aware of other clients that are currently "present" on a channel. Each member present on a channel has a unique self-assigned client identifier and system-assigned connection identifier, along with an optional payload that can be used to describe the member's status or attributes. Presence allows you to quickly build apps such as chat rooms and multiplayer games by automatically keeping track of who is present in real time across any device.

h2(#getting-started). Getting started

The @Presence@ object provides a straightforward API to subscribe to presence events such as members entering or leaving, retrieve a list of members present, or register the connected client as "present" on a channel. Here is a simple presence example using the "<span lang="default">@presence@</span><span lang="csharp">@Presence@</span>":/realtime/channels-messages#presence <span lang="default">property</span><span lang="java">field</span><span lang="ruby">attribute</span> of the "@Channel@":/realtime/channels-messages object to enter a channel and subscribe to presence events.

```[javascript](code-editor:realtime/presence-simple)
  var realtime = new Ably.Realtime({
    key: '{{API_KEY}}',
    clientId: 'bob' }
  );
  var channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
  channel.presence.subscribe('enter', function(member) {
    alert('Member ' + member.clientId + ' entered');
  });
  channel.presence.enter();
```

```[nodejs](code-editor:realtime/presence-simple)
  var Ably = require('ably');
  var realtime = new Ably.Realtime({
    key: '{{API_KEY}}',
    clientId: 'bob' }
  );
  var channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}');
  channel.presence.subscribe('enter', function(member) {
    alert('Member ' + member.clientId + ' entered');
  });
  channel.presence.enter();
```

```[ruby]
  realtime = Ably::Realtime.new(key: '{{API_KEY}}', client_id: 'bob')
  channel = realtime.channels.get('{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}')
  channel.presence.subscribe(:enter) do |member|
    puts "Member #{member.client_id} entered"
  end
  channel.presence.enter
```

```[java]
  ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions("{{API_KEY}}");
  options.clientId = "bob";
  AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime(options);
  Channel channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
  channel.presence.subscribe(new PresenceListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPresenceMessage(PresenceMessage member) {
      System.out.println("Member " + member.clientId + " : " + member.action.toString());
    }
  });
  channel.presence.enter(null, new CompletionListener());
```

```[csharp]
  var options = new ClientOptions("{{API_KEY}}") { ClientId =  "bob"};
  var realtime = new AblyRealtime(options);
  var channel = realtime.Channels.Get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}");
  channel.Presence.Subscribe(member => {
    Console.WriteLine("Member " + member.clientId + " : " + member.action)
  });
  await channel.Presence.EnterAsync(null);
```

```[objc]
  ARTClientOptions *options = [[ARTClientOptions alloc] initWithKey:@"{{API_KEY}}"];
  options.clientId = @"bob";
  ARTRealtime *realtime = [[ARTRealtime alloc] initWithOptions:options];
  ARTRealtimeChannel *channel = [realtime.channels get:@"{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}"];
  [channel.presence subscribe:ARTPresenceEnter callback:^(ARTPresenceMessage *member) {
      NSLog(@"Member %@ entered", member.clientId);
  }];
  [channel.presence enter:nil];
```

```[swift]
  let options = ARTClientOptions(key: "{{API_KEY}}")
  options.clientId = "bob"
  let realtime = ARTRealtime(options: options)
  let channel = realtime.channels.get("{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}")
  channel.presence.subscribe(.Enter) { member in
      print("Member \(member.clientId) entered")
  }
  channel.presence.enter(nil)
```

h2(#presence). Presence

In order to be present on a channel, a client must "be identified by having a client ID":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000038608-authenticated-and-identified-clients, "have permission to be present":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000048535-using-capabilities-to-manage-client-access-privileges-on-channels, and be attached to the channel. For simplicity, the library will implicitly attach to a channel when entering or subscribing to presence events. Clients are assigned a <span lang="default">"@clientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span> when using token authentication, "find out more about token authentication":/general/authentication#token-authentication.

A single <span lang="default">"@clientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span> may be present multiple times on the same channel via different client connections. As far as Ably is concerned, these are different members of the presence set for the channel, however they will be differentiated by their unique "<span lang="default">@connectionId@</span><span lang="csharp">@ConnectionId@</span><span lang="ruby">@connection_id@</span>":/realtime/connection/#id. For example, if a client with ID "Sarah" is connected to a chat channel on both a desktop and a mobile device simultaneously, "Sarah" will be present twice in the presence member set with the same client ID, yet will have two unique connection IDs. A member of the presence set is therefore unique by the combination of the <span lang="default">"@clientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span> and "<span lang="default">@connectionId@</span><span lang="csharp">@ConnectionId@</span><span lang="ruby">@connection_id@</span>":/realtime/connection/#id strings.

h3(#member-data). Member data

In addition to the <span lang="default">"@clientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span> for members on a channel, it is also possible to include data when entering a channel. Clients can "update":#update their data at any point which will be broadcasted to all presence subscribers as an <span lang="ruby">@:update@</span><span lang="java">@Action.UPDATE@</span><span lang="default">@update@</span> event.

```[jsall]
/* Subscribe to presence enter events */
channel.presence.on('enter', function(member) {
  console.log(member.data); // => not moving
});

/* Subscribe to presence update events */
channel.presence.on('update', function(member) {
  console.log(member.data); // => travelling North
});

/* Enter this client with data and update once entered */
channel.presence.enter('not moving', function(err) {
  channel.presence.update('travelling North');
});
```

```[java]
/* Subscribe to presence enter and update events */
channel.presence.subscribe(new PresenceListener() {
  @Override
  public void onPresenceMessage(PresenceMessage member) {
    switch (member.action) {
      case ENTER: {
        System.out.println(member.data); // => not moving
        break;
      }
      case UPDATE: {
        System.out.println(member.data); // => travelling North
        break;
      }
    }
  }
});

/* Enter this client with data and update once entered */
channel.presence.enter("not moving", new CompletionListener() {
  @Override
  public void onSuccess() {
    channel.presence.update("travelling North", new CompletionListener());
  }
});
```

```[csharp]
/* Subscribe to presence enter and update events */
channel.Presence.Subscribe(member =>

    {
        case PresenceAction.Enter:
        case PresenceAction.Update:
            {

await channel.Presence.EnterAsync("not moving");
await channel.Presence.UpdateAsync("travelling North");

  puts member.data # => not moving
end

# Subscribe to presence update events
channel.presence.subscribe(:update) do |member|
  puts member.data # => travelling North
end

# Enter this client with data and update once entered
channel.presence.enter(data: 'not moving') do

}

// Enter this client with data and update once entered
channel.presence.enter("not moving") { error in
    channel.presence.update("travelling North")
}
```

h3(#member-list). Presence member list

The @Presence@ object exposes a "<span lang="default">@get@</span><span lang="csharp">@Get@</span>":#get method allowing a client to retrieve an array of all members present on the channel. The Ably client is responsible for keeping track of the presence set from the time that the channel is attached; an up to date presence set is pushed to the client following attach and the presence set is updated on each subsequent presence event. Thus "<span lang="default">@get@</span><span lang="csharp">@Get@</span>":#get returns the already-known presence set retained in memory and does not trigger a new request to the Ably service.

```[jsall]
channel.presence.get(function(err, members) {
  console.log('There are ' + members.length + ' members on this channel');
  console.log('The first member has client ID: ' + members[0].clientId);
});
```

```[ruby]
channel.presence.get do |members|
  puts "There are #{members.size} members on this channel"
  puts "The first member has client ID: #{members.first.client_id}"
end
```

```[java]
PresenceMessage[] members = channel.presence.get();
System.out.println("There are " + members.length + " members on this channel");
System.out.println("The first member has client ID: " + members[0].clientId);
```

```[csharp]
IEnumerable<PresenceMessage> presence = await channel.Presence.GetAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"There are {presence.Count()} members on this channel");
Console.WriteLine($"The first member has client ID: {presence.First().clientId}");
```

```[objc]
[channel.presence get:^(NSArray<ARTPresenceMessage *> *members, ARTErrorInfo *error) {
    NSLog(@"There are %lu members on this channel", [members count]);
    NSLog(@"The first member has client ID: %@", members[0].clientId);
}];
```

```[swift]
channel.presence.get { members, error in
    print("There are \(members.count) members on this channel")
    print("The first member has client ID: \(members[0].clientId)")
}
```

h3(#presence-history). Presence History

The @Presence@ object exposes a "<span lang="default">@history@</span><span lang="csharp">@History@</span>":#history method allowing a client to retrieve historical presence events on the channel. Presence history can be used to return continuous presence event history up to the exact point a realtime channel was attached.

History provides access to instantaneous "live" history as well as the longer term persisted history for presence channels. If "persisted history":/realtime/history#persisted-history is enabled for the channel, then presence events will "typically be stored for 24 - 72 hours":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000030059-how-long-are-messages-stored-for. If persisted history is not enabled, Ably retains the last two minutes of presence event history in memory.

The following example retrieves the first two pages of historical presence events published up until the point the channel was attached.

bc[jsall]. channel.attach(function() {
  var presence = channel.presence;
  presence.history({ untilAttach: true }, function(err, resultPage) {
    if(err) {
      console.log('Unable to get presence history; err = ' + err.message);
    } else {
      console.log(resultPage.items.length + ' presence events received in first page');
      if(resultPage.hasNext()) {
        resultPage.next(function(err, nextPage) { ... });
      }
  });
});

bc[ruby]. channel.attach do
  presence = channel.presence
  presence.history(until_attach: true) do |result_page|
    puts "#{result_page.items.length} presence events received in first page"
    if result_page.has_next?
      result_page.next { |next_page| ... }
    end
  end
end

```[java]
Param[] options = new Param[]{ new Param("untilAttach", "true") }
PaginatedResult<PresenceMessage> resultPage = channel.presence.history(options);
System.out.println(resultPage.items().length + " presence events received in first page");
if(resultPage.hasNext()) {
  PaginatedResult<PresenceMessage> nextPage = resultPage.next();
  System.out.println(nextPage.items().length + " presence events received in 2nd page");
}
```

```[csharp]
PaginatedResult<PresenceMessage> resultPage;
resultPage = await channel.Presence.HistoryAsync(untilAttached: true);
Console.WriteLine(resultPage.Items.Count + " presence events received in first page");
if (resultPage.HasNext)
{
    PaginatedResult<PresenceMessage> nextPage = await resultPage.NextAsync();
    Console.WriteLine(nextPage.Items.Count + " presence events received in 2nd page");
}
```

```[objc]
ARTRealtimeHistoryQuery *query = [[ARTRealtimeHistoryQuery alloc] init];
query.untilAttach = YES;
[channel.presence history:query callback:^(ARTPaginatedResult<ARTPresenceMessage *> *resultPage,
                                           ARTErrorInfo *error) {
    NSLog(@"%lu presence events received in first page", [resultPage.items count]);
    if (resultPage.hasNext) {
        [resultPage next:^(ARTPaginatedResult<ARTPresenceMessage *> *nextPage, ARTErrorInfo *error) {
            NSLog(@"%lu presence events received in 2nd page", [nextPage.items count]);
        }];
    }
}];
```

```[swift]
let query = ARTRealtimeHistoryQuery()
query.untilAttach = true
channel.presence.history(query) { resultPage, error in
    let resultPage = resultPage!
    print("\(resultPage.items.count) presence events received in first page")
    if resultPage.hasNext {
        resultPage.next { nextPage, error in
            print("\(nextPage!.items.count) presence events received in 2nd page")
        }
    }
}
```

h3(#presence-multiple-client-id). Managing multiple client IDs

p(tip). Each unique <span lang="default">"@clientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span> may only be present once when entering on behalf of another client as the unique identifier for each member in a presence set is the combined <span lang="default">"@clientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span> and shared "<span lang="default">@connectionId@</span><span lang="csharp">@ConnectionId@</span><span lang="ruby">@connection_id@</span>":/realtime/connection/#id</span>

An Ably client instance might, if on an application server for example, publish messages and be present on channels on behalf of multiple distinct "client IDs":/realtime/usage#client-id. The channel's @Presence@ object therefore also supports methods that enable presence messages to be emitted for a <span lang="default">"@clientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span> specified at the time of the call, rather than implicitly based on the <span lang="default">"@clientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="ruby">"@client_id@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span><span lang="csharp">"@ClientId@":/realtime/usage#client-id</span> "specified when the library is instanced or authenticated":/realtime/usage#client-id.

In order to be able to publish presence changes for arbitrary client IDs, the client library must have been instanced either with an "API key":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000030054-what-is-an-app-api-key, or with a "token bound to a wildcard client ID":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000048586-can-a-client-emulate-any-client-id-i-e-use-a-wildcard-client-id.

h2(#properties).
  default: Presence Properties
  objc,swift: ARTPresence Properties
  ruby: Ably::Realtime::Presence Attributes
  java: io.ably.lib.realtime.Presence Members
  csharp: IO.Ably.Realtime.Presence Properties

The @Presence@ object exposes the following public <span lang="default">properties</span><span lang="ruby">attributes</span><span lang="java">members</span>:

h6(#sync-complete).
  default: syncComplete
  ruby: sync_complete?
  csharp: SyncComplete

A @boolean@ field indicating whether the presence member set is synchronised with server after a channel attach.
When a channel is attached, the Ably service immediately synchronises the presence member set with the client. Typically this process completes in milliseconds, however when the presence member set is very large, bandwidth constraints may slow this synchronisation process down.

h2. Methods

h6(#enter).
  default: enter
  csharp: EnterAsync

In order to enter and be present on a channel, the client must "be identified by having a client ID":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000038608-authenticated-and-identified-clients, "have permission to be present":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000048535-using-capabilities-to-manage-client-access-privileges-on-channels, and be attached to the channel. For simplicity, the library will implicitly attach to a channel when entering. Entering when already entered is treated as an "update":#update.

There are two overloaded versions of this method. <span lang="csharp"></span><span lang="default">
  With both versions, a <span lang="default">callback</span><span lang="ruby">block</span><span lang="java">completion listener</span> can optionally be passed in to be notified of success or failure to enter.
</span>

bq(definition#enter-none).
  default:  enter(callback("ErrorInfo":/realtime/types#error-info err))
  ruby:     "Deferrable":/realtime/types#deferrable enter() -> yields
  java:     void enter("CompletionListener":#completion-listener listener)
  objc,swift: enter(data: nil, callback: ((ARTErrorInfo?) -> Void)?)
  csharp:   Task EnterAsync()

Enter a presence channel without any data.

bq(definition#enter-data).
  default: enter(Object data, callback("ErrorInfo":/realtime/types#error-info err))
  ruby:    "Deferrable":/realtime/types#deferrable enter(Object data) -> yields
  java:    void enter(Object data, "CompletionListener":#completion-listener listener)
  objc,swift: enter(data: AnyObject?, callback: ((ARTErrorInfo?) -> Void)?)
  csharp:  Task EnterAsync(object clientData)

Enter a presence channel and provide data that is associated with the current present member.

h6(#get).
  default: get
  csharp: Get

Get the current presence member set for this channel. Typically, this method returns the member set immediately as the member set is retained in memory by the client. However, by default this method will wait until the presence member set is synchronised, so if the synchronisation is not yet complete following a channel being attached, this method will wait until the presence member set is synchronised.

When a channel is attached, the Ably service immediately synchronises the presence member set with the client. Typically this process completes in milliseconds, however when the presence member set is very large, bandwidth constraints may slow this synchronisation process down.

bq(definition).
  default: get(Object options, callback("ErrorInfo":/realtime/types#error-info err, "PresenceMessage[]":#presence-message members))
  ruby:    "Deferrable":/realtime/types#deferrable get(Hash options) -> yields "PresenceMessage[]":#presence-message

h6(#leave-client).
  default: leaveClient
  ruby: leave_client
  csharp: LeaveClientAsync

Leave this presence channel for the given <span lang="default">@clientId@</span><span lang="ruby">@client_id@</span><span lang="csharp">@ClientId@</span>. This method is provided to support typically server instances that act on behalf of multiple client IDs. See "Managing multiple client IDs":#presence-multiple-client-id for more info. In order to leave the presence set of a channel, the client must have already "entered and been present":#enter-client.

There are two overloaded versions of this method.
<span lang="csharp"></span><span lang="default">
  With both versions, a <span lang="default">callback</span><span lang="ruby">block</span><span lang="java">completion listener</span><span lang="csharp">handler</span> can optionally be passed in to be notified of success or failure to leave.
