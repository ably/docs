The Settings section in your Ably dashboard provides centralized configuration management for your application's core settings, security requirements, and protocol support. This interface enables you to customize your application's behavior, enforce security policies, and enable protocol adapters for different client types.

## Application settings

The application settings section contains the fundamental configuration options that define your application's identity and basic operational parameters.

### Basic application configuration

| Setting | Description | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| App ID | Unique identifier for your application | Keys and issued tokens are always prefixed with this ID |
| Name | Friendly name for your application | Used for your reference in the dashboard and documentation |

### Security settings

Configure security requirements that apply across your entire application:

| Security setting | Description | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| TLS required | Enforce encrypted connections for all clients | Check this if you want to enforce TLS for all connections |

When TLS required is enabled, this setting overrides any channel settings and ensures that all client connections must use encrypted transport protocols.

### Application status

Control whether your application accepts new connections and processes requests:

| Status setting | Description | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Active | Application operational status | Inactive applications will not accept new connections and will return an error to all clients |
| Enabled | Service availability status | When enabled, accepting new connections and all services are enabled |

## Protocol Adapter Settings

The Ably platform offers protocol adapter services that enable client libraries for different protocols to communicate directly with Ably, extending compatibility beyond native Ably SDKs.

### Protocol adapter overview

Protocol adapters allow clients using standard messaging protocols to connect to your Ably application without requiring Ably-specific client libraries. This enables integration with existing systems and tools that support these protocols.

### Available protocol adapters

| Protocol | Description | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pusher protocol support | Compatibility with Pusher client libraries | Optional | Please be aware that enabling this affects your app's security |
| PubNub protocol support | Compatibility with PubNub client libraries | Always-on | This is always-on for all customers |
| MQTT protocol support | Standard MQTT messaging protocol support | Always-on | This is always-on for all customers |
