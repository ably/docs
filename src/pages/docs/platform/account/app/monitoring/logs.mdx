The Logs section in your Ably dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities through detailed historical event logging across all aspects of your application. Access your application logs in the [app dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts/any/apps/any/logs) under the Logs section. These are historical logs with a short delay, not live logs. This interface enables you to track system activities, troubleshoot issues, and analyze patterns across API requests, channels, connections, integrations, and push notifications.

| Channels | Track channel events and activities |
| Connections | Monitor client connection events |
| Integration errors | Track integration failures and webhook issues |
| Push notifications | Monitor push notification delivery and errors |
| API integrations | Monitor third-party API integration events and errors |

Each section provides date range filtering and specialized search capabilities tailored to the specific type of events being monitored.
