The Ably REST client libraries provide a convenient and simple API to interact directly with the "Ably REST API":/rest-api/.  All official client library APIs are consistent across every language, enable publishing and retrieving of messages, handle both basic and token authentication, work around unavailable data centres, include optional symmetrical encryption and provide access to presence and metrics history.

The Ably REST client library is available in "most popular languages and platforms":https://ably.io/download/realtime-client-libraries including including "Javascript browser library":https://github.com/ably/ably-js, "Java":https://github.com/ably/ably-java, ".NET":https://github.com/ably/dot-net, "Node.js":https://github.com/ably/ably-js, "iOS":https://github.com/ably/ably-ios, "Python":https://github.com/ably/ably-python, "Ruby":https://github.com/ably/ably-ruby-rest, "Go":https://github.com/ably/ably-go and "more...":https://ably.io/download/rest-client-libraries

h2. Dive into the documentation

The REST Client Library documentation API is broken down as follows:

* "Constructor & usage examples":usage
* "Channels & Messages":channels-messages
* "Presence":presence
* "Authentication":authentication
* "History":history
* "Statistics":statistics
* "Encryption":encryption

p(tip). Use the Ably REST client libraries as they provide features that the REST API cannot support such as encryption or automatic fail-over to alternate data centers should the closest data center become unavailable.

h2. REST API Specification
