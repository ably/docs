Welcome to Ably. This guide shows you how to integrate Ably's realtime platform into an application.

You'll learn how to:

* Include an Ably Client Library SDK in a project.
* Establish a realtime connection to Ably.
* Subscribe to a channel to receive messages.
* Publish a message on a channel.
* Close a connection to Ably.

Ably Client Library SDKs are available in multiple programming languages. Some SDKs have a realtime and a REST interface, while others only have a REST interface. The "SDK downloads":https://ably.com/download page lists availability. For further information on when it's best to use the realtime or REST SDK, see "the best practice guide":https://ably.com/documentation/best-practice-guide#choosing-between-realtime-rest-mqtt.

p(tip#terms). The terms used in the guide such as 'connection', 'channel', 'message', 'publish' and 'subscribe' are described in the "glossary":/glossary.

h2(#step-1). Step 1: Add the Ably Client Library SDK

blang[javascript].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available via CDN.

  To get started with your project, reference the SDK within the @<head>@ of an HTML page:

  bc[html]. <script src="https://cdn.ably.com/lib/ably.min-1.js"></script>

  The SDK is also available as an "NPM module":https://www.npmjs.com/package/ably.

blang[nodejs].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available as an "NPM module":https://www.npmjs.com/package/ably.

  To get started with your project, install the SDK:

  ```[sh]
  npm install ably
  ```

  Include the SDK as a module in your @.js@ files:

  ```[nodejs]
  const Ably = require('ably');
  ```

blang[ruby].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available as a "Ruby Gem":https://rubygems.org/gems/ably.

  To get started with your project, install the SDK:

  ```[sh]
  gem install ably
  ```

  Include the SDK in your @.rb@ files:

  ```[ruby]
  require 'ably'
  ```

blang[python].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available from "PyPI":https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ably. Note that the Python SDK only implements the REST interface.

  To get started with your project, install the SDK:

  bc[sh]. pip install ably

  Import the SDK with:

  bc[python]. from ably import AblyRest

blang[php].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available as a composer package on "packagist":https://packagist.org/packages/ably/ably-php. Note that the PHP SDK only implements the REST interface.
  
  To get started with your project, install the SDK:

  bc[sh]. composer require ably/ably-php --update-no-dev

  Include the composer's autoloader with:

  bc[php]. require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

blang[java].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available on "GitHub":https://github.com/ably/ably-java and hosted on "Maven Central":https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central.

  To get started with your project, add the SDK into your @build.gradle@ dependencies section and a reference to Maven in the repositories section if it isn't included by default.

  For Java applications:

  ```[java]
  dependencies {
    implementation 'io.ably:ably-java:1.2.0'
  }

  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  ```

  For Android apps:

  ```[java]
  dependencies {
    implementation 'io.ably:ably-android:1.2.0'
  }

  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  ```

  *Note*: In the above examples a specific version of the SDK is referenced. Ably recommends that you always use the latest stable version available for "Java":https://bintray.com/ably-io/ably/ably-java and "Android":https://bintray.com/ably-io/ably/ably-android.

  Ensure the SDK is included in your classpath using:

  ```[java]
  import io.ably.lib.types.*;
  import io.ably.lib.realtime.*;
  ```

blang[objc].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available as a CocoaPod.

  To get started with your project, add the SDK to your Podfile:

  ```[text]
  pod 'Ably'
  ```

  Install the SDK with:
  
  ```[sh]
  pod install
  ``` 
  
  Import the SDK into your files with:

  ```[objc]
  #import "Ably.h"
  ```

blang[swift].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available as a CocoaPod.

  To get started with your project, add the SDK to your Podfile:

  ```[text]
  pod 'Ably'
  ```

  Install the SDK with:
  
  ```[sh]
  pod install
  ``` 
  
  Import the SDK into your files with:

  ```[swift]
  import Ably
  ```

blang[csharp].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is available as a "Nuget package":https://www.nuget.org/packages/ably.io/. 
  
  To get started with your project, install the SDK from the Package Manager Console:

  ```[text]
  PM> Install-Package ably.io
  ```

blang[flutter].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is hosted on "GitHub":https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter and available as a "Flutter plugin":https://pub.dev/packages/ably_flutter. 
  
  To get started with your project, update your @pubspec.yaml@ with the package and version:

  ```[yaml]
  dependencies:
    # ...
    ably_flutter: [version]
    # ...
  ```

  Import the package into your Dart file:

  ```[flutter]
  import 'package:ably_flutter/ably_flutter.dart' as ably;
  ```

blang[go].
  The Ably Client Library SDK is hosted on "Github":https://github.com/ably/ably-go and can be installed by running the @go get@ command:

  ```[go]
  go get -u github.com/ably/ably-go/ably
  ```

  Import the packages into your Go file:

  bc[go]. import (
      "context"
      "fmt"
      "github.com/ably/ably-go/ably"
  )

h2(#step-2). Step 2: Connect to Ably 

blang[default].
  Clients need to authenticate with Ably to establish a realtime connection. The following code sample uses a demo API key to authenticate and print the message @Connected to Ably!@ when you've successfully connected.

  Alternatively, you can use your own API key if you already have an account, or "sign up":https://ably.com/signup for a free account to obtain one. Just ensure that the key provides the subscribe and publish "capabilities":/core-features/authentication#capabilities-explained.

blang[python,php].
  The <span lang="python">Python</span><span lang="php">PHP</span> SDK is only available with a REST interface. You will need to use one of the realtime libraries to create a realtime connection to Ably. Use the language selector above to select a language with realtime support.

*Note*: The connection example uses basic authentication to pass the API key from the application to Ably. Basic authentication should not be used client-side in a production environment, such as in a browser, to avoid exposing the API key. "Token authentication":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication should be used instead.

bc[javascript](code-editor:quick-start-guide/connect). const ably = new Ably.Realtime('{{API_KEY}}');
ably.connection.on('connected', () => {
  alert('Connected to Ably!');
});

bc[nodejs](code-editor:quick-start-guide/connect). const ably = new Ably.Realtime('{{API_KEY}}');
ably.connection.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('Connected to Ably!');
});

bc[java]. ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions("{{API_KEY}}");
AblyRealtime ably = new AblyRealtime(options);
ably.connection.on(ConnectionState.connected, new ConnectionStateListener() {
  @Override
  public void onConnectionStateChanged(ConnectionStateChange state) {
    System.out.println("New state is " + state.current.name());
    switch (state.current) {
      case connected: {
        // Successful connection
        System.out.println("Connected to Ably!");
        break;
      }
      case failed: {
        // Failed connection
        break;
      }
    }
  }
});

bc[ruby]. EventMachine.run do
  ably = Ably::Realtime.new(key: '{{API_KEY}}')
  ably.connection.on(:connected) do
    puts "Connected to Ably!"
  end
end

bc[swift]. let ably = ARTRealtime(key: "{{API_KEY}}")
ably.connection.on(.connected) {
    print("Connected to Ably!")
}

bc[csharp]. var ably = new AblyRealtime("{{API_KEY}}");
ably.Connection.On(ConnectionState.Connected, args =>
{
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Connected to Ably!");
});

bc[objc]. ARTRealtime *ably = [[ARTRealtime alloc] initWithKey:@"{{API_KEY}}"];
[ably.connection on:ARTRealtimeConnectionEventConnected callback:^(ARTConnectionStateChange *stateChange) {
    NSLog(@"Connected to Ably!");
}];

bc[flutter]. final clientOptions = ably.ClientOptions.fromKey('{{API_KEY}}');
final realtime = ably.Realtime(options: clientOptions);
realtime.connection
  .on(ably.ConnectionEvent.connected)
  .listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
    print('New state is: ${stateChange.current}');
    switch (stateChange.current) {
      case ably.ConnectionState.connected:
        // Successful connection
        print('Connected to Ably!');
        break;
      case ably.ConnectionState.failed:
        // Failed connection
        break;
    }
});

bc[go]. // Instantiate the Ably client. Calling ably.WithAutoConnect(false) is optional
// but ensures that you don't miss state changes.
client, err := ably.NewRealtime(ably.WithKey("{{API_KEY}}"), ably.WithAutoConnect(false))
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
client.Connection.OnAll(func(change ably.ConnectionStateChange) {
    fmt.Printf("Connection event: %s state=%s reason=%s\n", change.Event, change.Current, change.Reason)
})
client.Connect()

h2(#step-3). Step 3: Subscribe to a channel

blang[default].
  Messages are broadcast on channels. The following example code subscribes the client to a channel called @quickstart@ and sets a filter so that the client only receives messages with the name @greeting@. When a message is received, its contents will be printed after the text @Received a greeting message in realtime:@. 

  *Note*: The channel is created in the Ably service when the client subscribes to it.

blang[python,php].
  The <span lang="python">Python</span><span lang="php">PHP</span> SDK is only available with a REST interface. You will need to use one of the realtime libraries to subscribe to a channel and receive messages. Use the language selector above to select a language with realtime support.

```[javascript](code-editor:quick-start-guide/send-message)
  const channel = ably.channels.get('quickstart');
  channel.subscribe('greeting', (message) => {
    alert(`Received a greeting message in realtime: ${message.data}`);
  });
```

```[nodejs](code-editor:quick-start-guide/send-message)
  const channel = ably.channels.get('quickstart');
  channel.subscribe('greeting', (message) => {
    console.log(`Received a greeting message in realtime: ${message.data}`);
  });
```

```[ruby]
  channel = ably.channels.get('quickstart')
  channel.subscribe('greeting') do |message|
    puts "Received a greeting message in realtime: #{message.data}"
  end
```

```[java]
  Channel channel = ably.channels.get("quickstart");
  channel.subscribe("greeting", new Channel.MessageListener() {
    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
      System.out.println("Received a greeting message in realtime: " + message.data);
    }
  });
```

bc[swift]. let channel = ably.channels.get("quickstart")
channel.subscribe("greeting") { message in
    print("Received a greeting message in realtime: \(message.data)")
}

bc[csharp]. var channel = ably.Channels.Get("quickstart");
channel.Subscribe(message =>
{
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Received a greeting message in realtime: {0}", message.Data);
});

bc[objc]. ARTRealtimeChannel *channel = [ably.channels get:@"quickstart"];
[channel subscribe:@"greeting" callback:^(ARTMessage *message) {
    NSLog(@"Received a greeting message in realtime: %@", message.data);
}];

bc[flutter]. final channel = realtime.channels.get('quickstart');
channel.subscribe().listen((message) {
      print('Received a greeting message in realtime: ${message.data}');
    }
  );

bc[go]. channel := client.Channels.Get("quickstart")
_, err = channel.Subscribe(context.Background(), "greeting", func(msg *ably.Message) {
    fmt.Printf("Received message : '%v'\n", msg.Data)
})
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

h2(#step-4). Step 4: Publish a message

The following example code publishes a message to the @quickstart@ channel with the name @greeting@ and the contents @hello!@.

bc[jsall](code-editor:quick-start-guide/send-message). const channel = ably.channels.get('quickstart');
channel.publish('greeting', 'hello!');

bc[java]. Channel channel = ably.channels.get("quickstart");
channel.publish("greeting", "hello", new CompletionListener() {
  @Override
  public void onSuccess() {
    System.out.println("Message sent");
  }
  @Override
  public void onError(ErrorInfo reason) {
    System.out.println("Message not sent, error occurred: " + reason.message);
  }
});

bc[csharp]. var channel = ably.Channels.Get("quickstart");
channel.Publish("greeting", "hello!");

bc[python]. client = AblyRest('{{API_KEY}}')
channel = client.channels.get('quickstart')
channel.publish(u'greeting', u'hello!')

bc[ruby]. channel = ably.channels.get('quickstart')
channel.publish 'greeting', 'hello!'

bc[php]. $channel = $ably->channels->get('quickstart');
$channel->publish('greeting', 'hello!');

bc[swift]. let channel = ably.channels.get("quickstart")
channel.publish("greeting", data: "hello!")

bc[objc]. ARTRealtimeChannel *channel = [ably.channels get:@"quickstart"];
[channel publish:@"greeting" data:@"hello!"];

bc[flutter]. final channel = realtime.channels.get('quickstart');
await channel.publish(name: 'greeting', data: 'hello!');

bc[go]. channel := client.Channels.Get("quickstart")
err = channel.Publish(context.Background(), "greeting", "hello!")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

h3(#rest-api). Publish with the REST API

It's possible to interact directly with the "HTTP REST API":/rest-api even though the SDKs are the recommended way to develop and interact with Ably.

Copy the following @curl@ code sample into your terminal to publish a message and view the response in your browser.

bc[sh]. curl https://rest.ably.io/channels/{{RANDOM_CHANNEL_NAME}}/publish \
  --user "{{API_KEY}}" \
  --data "name=greeting&data=Hello"

h2(#step-5). Step 5: Close a connection to Ably 

blang[default].
  A connection to Ably can be closed once it is no longer needed.

  The following code sample explicitly closes the realtime connection to Ably and prints the message @Closed the connection to Ably.@.

blang[python,php].
  The <span lang="python">Python</span><span lang="php">PHP</span> SDK is only available with a REST interface. You will need to use one of the realtime libraries to create or manage a connection to Ably. Use the language selector above to select a language with realtime support.

bc[javascript](code-editor:quick-start-guide/close). ably.connection.close();
ably.connection.on('closed', () => {
  alert('Closed the connection to Ably.');
});

bc[nodejs](code-editor:quick-start-guide/close). ably.connection.close();
ably.connection.on('closed', () => {
  console.log('Closed the connection to Ably.');
});

bc[java]. ably.connection.close();
ably.connection.on(ConnectionState.closed, new ConnectionStateListener() {
  @Override
  public void onConnectionStateChanged(ConnectionStateChange state) {
    System.out.println("New state is " + state.current.name());
    switch (state.current) {
      case closed: {
        // Connection closed
        System.out.println("Closed the connection to Ably.");
        break;
      }
      case failed: {
        // Failed to close connection
        break;
      }
    }
  }
});

bc[ruby]. ably.connection.close
ably.connection.on(:closed) do
  puts "Closed the connection to Ably!"
end

bc[swift]. ably.connection.close()
ably.connection.on(.closed) {
    print("Closed connection to Ably.")
}

bc[csharp]. ably.Connection.Close;
ably.Connection.On(ConnectionState.Closed, args =>
{
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Closed connection to Ably.");
});

bc[objc]. ably.connection.close();
[ably.connection on:ARTRealtimeConnectionEventClosed callback:^(ARTConnectionStateChange *stateChange) {
    NSLog(@"Closed connection to Ably.");
}];

bc[flutter]. realtime.connection.close();
realtime.connection
  .on(ably.ConnectionEvent.closed)
  .listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
    print('New state is: ${stateChange.current}');
    switch (stateChange.current) {
      case ably.ConnectionState.closed:
        // Connection closed
        print('Closed connection to Ably.');
        break;
      case ably.ConnectionState.failed:
        // Failed to close connection
        break;
    }
});

bc[go]. client.Connection.On(ably.ConnectionEventClosed, func(change ably.ConnectionStateChange) {
    fmt.Println("Closed the connection to Ably.")
})
client.Close()
