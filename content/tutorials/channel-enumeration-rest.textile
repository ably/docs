title: Channel Enumeration using the REST API
section: tutorials
index: 14
---

Ably Realtime's Data Stream Network organizes all the message traffic within its applications into named "channels":https://www.ably.io/channels. Channels are the “unit” of message distribution; clients attach to any number of channels to subscribe to messages, and every message published to a channel is broadcasted to all subscribers. 

Many times, developers find it helpful to be aware of specific metadata related to their channels. This metadata can be accessed in the form of the channel lifecycle events, channel occupancy events or even channel enumeration, i.e., listing all the active channels associated with a particular API key in an app via our Channel Lifecycle API. In this tutorial, we'll see how to implement channel enumeration functionality.

Channel enumeration can be currently implemented via our "REST API":/rest-api only; however, you can still use our "REST client library":/rest to send requests to the REST API as you'll see further down this tutorial.

h2(#permissions). Step 2 - Setting the right permissions on your API key

In order to be able to use the enumeration feature, you'll need to ensure that the @Channel Metadata@ permission is enabled on your API key. "Permissions":/core-features/authentication/#capabilities-explained (or privileges or capabilities, used interchangeably) restrict your API key from being used to performing specific actions only, such as publish-and-subscribe or publish-only, etc. These privileges can be set on your API key via your account dashboard. Navigate to the 'API Keys' tab of your dashboard as shown in the image below and click on the 'settings' button against an existing API key that you'd like to use or create a new one.

</a>

From the list of privileges, enable the @Channel Metadata@ privilege, and you are good to go on the permissions part of it.

h2(#front-end). Step 3 - Creating a basic HTML page to display the results

Since we'll be using JavaScript in this tutorial, the best way to display the results is in a browser. So, go ahead and paste the following simple HTML in a file and name it @index.html@

```[html]
<html>

<head>
    <title>Channel Enumeration</title>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script lang="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.ably.io/lib/ably-1.js"></script>
</head>

<body style="padding: 60px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Ably Channel Enumeration using REST API - Demo
    <br/>
    <div>
        <button id='enumerate' onclick="enumerateChannels()">Enumerate channels</button>
        <br>
        <textarea id="result" rows="30" style="width: 30%; margin-top: 14px; font-family: courier, courier new; background-color: #333; color: orange;  overflow-y: scroll;"
            disabled>
        </textarea>
    </div>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```


The key thing to note in the HTML above is the inclusion of two JS files, one is the Ably Library, referenced via the CDN, while the other is the @main.js@ file which will include our logic. We'll work on this next.


h2(#performing-the-rest-request). Step 4 - Using Ably's REST library to perform a REST API request

As mentioned before, channel enumeration can currently be implemented only via our "REST API":/rest-api. However, the "REST library":/rest offers a "request() method":https://www.ably.io/documentation/rest/usage#request to perform REST requests directly with our raw REST API.

For the simplicity of this tutorial, we'll use "Basic authentication":/core-features/authentication#basic-authentication to perform the request. However, it is highly recommended to use "Token auth":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication on client-side applications for "better security and protection of your API key":/root/best-practice-guide#using-api-key-client-side.

In order to receive channel enumeration information, we'll have to make use of the @/channels@ endpoint of "Ably's REST API":rest-api. We'll perform a @GET@ request using the REST library, and the result of this request will be an "HTTPPaginatedResponse":https://www.ably.io/documentation/rest/usage#http-paginated-response object. This allows the results to be returned in a paginated fashion, i.e, it returns a page of results and allows you to automatically request for more pages until all of the available results are returned.

Let's begin with instantiating the Ably REST library using the API key. Create a new file called @main.js@ and add the following to it.

```[javascript]
var ably = new Ably.Rest('<YOUR-API-KEY>');
```

Next, let's go ahead and perform the actual REST request using the @request()@ method as follows:

```[javascript]
var URL = '/channels';
var resultArea = document.getElementById('result');
var channelCount = 0;
//request a list of channels on button click
function enumerateChannels() {
    ably.request('get', URL, { limit: 100, direction: 'forwards' }, null, null, (err, results) => {
        if (err) {
            resultArea.value += 'An error occurred; err = ' + err.toString();
        } else {
            displayResults(results)
            while (results.hasNext()) {
                results.next(function (err, nextPage) {
                    displayResults(nextPage);
                });
            }
        }
    })
}
//display results in the text area
function displayResults(results) {
    resultArea.value += "Your API key has the following active channels:\n";
    results.first((err, resultPage) => {
        for (var i = 0; i < resultPage.items.length; i++) {
            var resultObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(resultPage.items[i]));
            channelCount++;
            resultArea.value += channelCount + ". " + resultObj.name + "\n";

        }
    })
}
```

Remember to replace <YOUR-API-KEY> with an actual Ably API key.

In the code above, we have set the REST endpoint to be @/channels@. The @enumerateChannels()@ function is invoked on a button click from the front end. Inside this function, we have made a simple request to Ably's REST API, using Ably's JavaScript REST client library. We can optionally specify a limit to the results returned; you can have a look at the "API reference":/general/channel-lifecycle.textile in the docs to learn more. As mentioned before, the results are returned in the form of an @HTTPPaginatedResponse@; hence we are required to process them page by page. Each page contains one @Channel@ object per active channel that exists within an app. Here, we are merely displaying the name of each of these channels in the text area we created in HTML.
