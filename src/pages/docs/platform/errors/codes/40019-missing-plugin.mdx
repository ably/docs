# Error 40019: Missing Plugin

## What Happened

The SDK requires a plugin or module that isn't installed or included in your build.

## Quick Reference
| Error Code | HTTP Status | Category | Retryable |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 40019 | 400 | Client Error (Missing Plugin) | No - requires installing missing plugin |

## Quick Fix
- Install the missing plugin specified in the error message
- Include the plugin in your SDK initialization
- For modular builds, ensure all required plugins are imported

## Error Messages

You may see one of these messages:
- "Missing Vcdiff decoder (https://github.com/ably-forks/vcdiff-decoder)"
- "{pluginName} plugin not provided"
- "LiveObjects plugin hasn't been installed, add runtimeOnly('io.ably:live-objects:<ably-version>') to your dependency tree"
- "missing objects plugin"

## Common Causes

1. **VCDiff decoder not installed** (JavaScript/React Native)
   - Using delta compression without the VCDiff decoder plugin
   - Receiving messages with 'vcdiff' encoding
   - Missing TextEncoder polyfill in React Native
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40019-analysis.md lines 15-20 -->

2. **LiveObjects module missing** (Java/Android)
   - Attempting to use LiveObjects features
   - Missing runtime dependency in build configuration
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40019-analysis.md lines 30-35 -->

3. **Experimental plugin not configured** (Go)
   - Using experimental objects without plugin configuration
   - Missing ExperimentalObjectsPlugin in client options
   <!-- Source: Analysis from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40019-analysis.md lines 39-44 -->

4. **Modular build missing components** (JavaScript)
   - Using modular SDK build without required plugins
   - Optional features not included in custom build

## Resolution Steps

### JavaScript/TypeScript

1. **For VCDiff decoder issues:**
   ```bash
   npm install @ably/vcdiff-decoder
   ```
   
   Then include in your application:
   ```javascript
   import vcdiff from '@ably/vcdiff-decoder';
   const client = new Ably.Realtime({ 
     key: 'your-key',
     plugins: { vcdiff }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 52-63 -->

2. **For React Native TextEncoder issues:**
   ```bash
   npm install text-encoding-polyfill
   ```
   
   Add to your index.js:
   ```javascript
   import 'text-encoding-polyfill';
   ```
   <!-- Source: Slack discussion from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 144-149 -->

3. **For modular build plugins:**
   ```javascript
   import { Realtime } from 'ably/modular';
   import { 
     WebSocketTransport, 
     FetchRequest,
     // Include other required plugins
   } from 'ably/modular/plugins';
   
   const client = new Realtime({
     key: 'your-key',
     plugins: {
       WebSocketTransport,
       FetchRequest,
       // Add plugins for features you need
     }
   });
   ```
   <!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 65-79 -->

### Java/Android

**For LiveObjects features:**

Using Gradle:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.ably:ably-android:1.x.x'
    runtimeOnly 'io.ably:live-objects:1.x.x' // Match SDK version
}
```

Using Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.ably</groupId>
    <artifactId>live-objects</artifactId>
    <version>1.x.x</version> <!-- Match SDK version -->
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```
<!-- Source: Knowledge from https://github.com/ably/ably-os/blob/main/output/error-codes/research/40019-knowledge.md lines 81-99 -->

### Go

**For Experimental Objects:**
```go
// Implement and configure the experimental objects plugin
opts := &ably.ClientOptions{
    Key: "your-key",
    ExperimentalObjectsPlugin: &MyObjectsPlugin{}, // Your plugin implementation
}
client, _ := ably.NewRealtime(opts)
```

## Automatic Handling

This error requires manual intervention. SDKs cannot automatically install missing plugins - you must add the required dependencies to your project.

## Prevention

- **Check documentation** for feature-specific plugin requirements before using advanced features
- **Match versions** - Ensure plugin versions match your SDK version
- **Minimal builds** - Only include plugins for features you actually use to optimize bundle size
- **Test thoroughly** - Verify all required features work in development before deploying

<!-- DOCUMENTATION SHORTCOMINGS:
⚠️ Areas where Ably documentation could be improved:
- Missing: Clear documentation on which features require which plugins
- Impact: Developers don't know plugin requirements until runtime errors occur
- Recommendation: Create a plugin requirements matrix in SDK documentation
- Severity: Medium - causes runtime surprises but has clear solutions
-->

To improve this error code documentation:
1. First approach: Update editorial-notes.md in ably-os repository with specific guidance for error 40019
2. Regenerate: Run `./bin/ably-os errors document-error-codes 40019 --force`
