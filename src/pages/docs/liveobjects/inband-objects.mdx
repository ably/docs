<Aside data-type='experimental'>
LiveObjects is currently Experimental. Its features are still in development and subject to rapid change.

**Building with LiveObjects?** Help shape its future by [sharing your use case](https://44qpp.share.hsforms.com/2fZobHQA1ToyRfB9xqZYQmQ).
</Aside>

Inband objects enables clients to subscribe to LiveObjects updates in realtime, even on platforms that don't yet have a native LiveObjects Realtime client implementation.

<Aside data-type='note'>
If you're using LiveObjects from one of the the following languages, then use the LiveObjects plugin which has dedicated support for all LiveObjects features:

* [JavaScript/TypeScript](/docs/liveobjects/quickstart/javascript)
* [Swift](/docs/liveobjects/quickstart/swift)
</Aside>

Inband objects works by delivering changes to channel objects as regular channel messages, similar to [inband occupancy](/docs/channels/options#occupancy).

## Enable Inband Objects <a id="inband-objects-enable"/>

To enable inband objects, use the `objects` [channel parameter](/docs/channels/options#objects) when getting a channel:

<Code>
```javascript
// When getting a channel instance
const channelOpts = { params: { objects: 'objects' } };
const channel = realtime.channels.get('my-channel', channelOpts);

// Or using setOptions on an existing channel
await channel.setOptions({ params: { objects: 'objects' } });
```
</Code>

<Aside data-type='important'>
Clients require the `channel-metadata` [capability](/docs/auth/capabilities) to receive inband objects updates.
</Aside>

## Subscribe to updates <a id="inband-objects-subscribe"/>

When using inband objects, the client will receive special `[meta]objects` messages whenever the objects on the channel are updated. These messages provide a snapshot of the current set of objects on the channel.

<Aside data-type='note'>
If there is a high rate of updates to the channel objects the inband messages will be throttled. However the client is guaranteed to receive a sequence of inband messages after the last change occurs so that the latest data is always available.
</Aside>

[Subscribe](/docs/api/realtime-sdk/channels#subscribe) to `[meta]objects` messages like you would any other message on the channel. For convenience, use a message name filter to only receive messages with the name `[meta]objects` in your listener:

<Code>
```javascript
// Subscribe to [meta]objects messages
channel.subscribe('[meta]objects', (message) => {
  const { syncId, nextCursor, object } = message.data;
  console.log("Received inband objects message:", syncId, nextCursor, JSON.stringify(message.data));
});
```
</Code>

## Message Format <a id="inband-objects-message-format"/>

Inband objects messages are sent as a sequence of messages, where each message contains a snapshot of a single object on the channel. Taken together, a set of messages belonging to the same sequence describes the complete set of objects on the channel.

Each inband objects message has a message `name` of `[meta]objects`.

The message `data` is a JSON object with the following top-level properties:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `syncId` | A unique ID for this sequence. All messages with the same `syncId` are part of the same sequence of messages which describes the complete set of the objects on the channel. |
| `nextCursor` | A cursor for the next message in the sequence, or `undefined` if this is the last message in the sequence. |
| `object` | A JSON representation of the object included in the message. |

The shape of the `object` is the same as the response format of an object when listing them via the [REST API](/docs/liveobjects/rest-api-usage#fetching-objects-list-values).
