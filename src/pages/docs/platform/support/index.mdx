### Support ticket information <a id="info"/>

The following information is useful for helping troubleshoot your issue when you submit a support ticket:

* Time and date that the issue occurred.
  * Note whether it is consistent or a one-time event.
  * Provide timestamps in UTC format.
* Information about the SDK(s) used.
  * Include the platform and versions.
  * If the issue occurred following an upgrade, please mention the previous and current versions.
* Client information.
  * Include the `appID` associated with the request.
  * Include the `clientId`s of any affected clients.
  * Specify on which channel the issue occurred.
  * State whether you use custom client options, for example a custom environment.
  * Specify which endpoints or which SDK operation was used.
  * List any error codes received.
* Verbose logs replicating the issue.
  * Include logs from the time immediately before and after the issue occurred.
  * Include any relevant parts of your code which might assist us in replicating the issue.
  * If the issue is easily reproducible, sharing a screen recording or Gist can be helpful.

The following code demonstrates how to enable verbose logging in Ably Pub/Sub SDKs:

<Code>
```javascript
var ably = new Ably.Realtime(
{ /* existing options */,
logLevel:4
});
```

```java
ClientOptions clientOptions = new ClientOptions();
/* existing options */
clientOptions.logLevel = Log.VERBOSE;
ablyRealtime = new AblyRealtime(clientOptions);
```

```go
client, err := ably.NewRealtime(/*existing options*/,ably.WithLogLevel(4))
  if err != nil {
        panic(err)
  }
```

```swift
let clientOptions = ARTClientOptions();
/* existing options */
clientOptions.logLevel = .debug;
let realtime = ARTRealtime(options: clientOptions);
```

```php
$clientOptions = array(
 /* existing options */,
'logLevel' => 4, );

$ably = new \Ably\AblyRest($clientOptions);
```

```python
import logging
import ably

ablyLog = logging.getLogger('ably')
ablyLog.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
ablyLog.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())

# add a formatter object to format timestamps:
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(message)s')
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
```

```ruby
ably = Ably::Realtime.new(=begin existing client options =end, log_level: :debug)
```

```flutter
import 'package:ably_flutter/ably_flutter.dart' as ably;

var clientOptions = ably.ClientOptions(/* existing client options */,
logLevel: ably.LogLevel.verbose);
```
</Code>
