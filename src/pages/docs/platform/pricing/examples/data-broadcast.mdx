title: Data broadcast pricing example
meta_description: "A pricing example that uses Ably Pub/Sub for data broadcast. Example shows how message conflation reduces message costs from ~$1,800 to ~$370/month for 10K users across 50 matches."
meta_keywords: "sports betting, live odds, realtime odds updates, message conflation, Pub/Sub pricing, betting platform, live sports data, odds streaming, realtime data delivery, Ably Pub/Sub pricing"
intro: "This Pub/Sub example demonstrates consumption-based pricing for a realtime data broadcast – a single source publishing frequent updates to many subscribers."
---
This example uses a sports betting scenario where odds are updated and fanned out to bettors. The same pattern applies to any broadcast where only the latest value matters, such as stock tickers, live scores, auction platforms and transport arrivals.

## Assumptions

- 10,000 monthly active users
- 50 live matches per month
- 200 concurrent viewers per match
- 2-hour match duration
- 60-minute average session duration
- 10 raw odds updates per second from data provider
- Message conflation enabled (500ms interval)

These assumptions generate:
- [147,600,000 messages](#messages)
- [2,400,000 connection minutes](#minutes)
- [4,800,000 channel minutes](#minutes)

<Aside data-type='note'>
Conflation intervals are configurable from 100ms to 500ms – lower intervals reduce latency; higher intervals reduce message volume and costs.

## Cost summary

The high-level cost breakdown for this scenario. Messages are billed for both inbound (published to Ably) and outbound (delivered to subscribers).

| Item | Calculation | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Messages (with conflation) | (3,600,000 inbound + 144,000,000 outbound = 147,600,000) × $2.50/M | $369 |
| Connection minutes | 2,400,000 × $1.00/M | $2.40 |
| Channel minutes | 4,800,000 × $1.00/M | $4.80 |
| Package fee |  | [See plans](/docs/platform/pricing) |
| **Total** |  | **~$376.20/month** |

## Message breakdown <a id="messages"/>

How the message total is calculated. Conflation reduces outbound delivery from 10 updates/sec to 2 updates/sec (500ms interval).

| Item | Calculation | Messages |
|------|-------------|------|
| Inbound (from data provider) | 10 updates/sec × 7,200 sec × 50 matches | 3,600,000 |
| Outbound (to viewers, with conflation) | 2 updates/sec × 7,200 sec × 200 viewers × 50 matches | 144,000,000 |
| **Total** |  | **147,600,000** |


## Connection and channel minutes <a id="minutes"/>

The following table shows how connection and channel minute costs are calculated in this example:

| Metric | Calculation | Monthly | Cost |
|--------|-------------|---------|------|
| Connection minutes | 10,000 users × 4 sessions × 60 mins | 2,400,000 | $2.40 |
| Channel minutes | 40,000 sessions × 60 mins × 2 channels | 4,800,000 | $4.80 |


## Why conflation, not batching?

For live betting, [message conflation](/docs/messages#conflation) is the right optimization because:

- Old odds are semantically stale — batching would group outdated prices together
- Users need the latest price, not a history of price changes
- Conflation reduces both inbound and outbound message costs

Use [server-side batching](/docs/messages/batch#server-side) instead when every message matters, for example in a chat use case or when you're sending push notifications.

<Aside data-type='note'>
Without conflation: 723,600,000 messages = ~$1,809 in message costs. Conflation saves ~80%.

## Further optimization: Delta compression

For richer payloads such as full market depth or live statistics, [delta compression](/docs/channels/options/deltas) can reduce bandwidth costs by sending only the difference between updates.

| Payload type | Full size | With delta | Bandwidth reduction |
|--------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Full market (10+ selections) | 8 KiB | ~2 KiB | 75% |
| Live stats + odds bundle | 15 KiB | ~4 KiB | 73% |
