Ably Channels support the concept of presence. Each channel may have a presence set associated with it, which is a set of clientIds for those clients that have announced their presence by entering the channel.

A client must be attached to a channel, and must have the relevant permission, in order to enter, although the library implicitly calls @attach()@ if the client is not attached at the time @enter()@ is called. As with other channel messages, the library allows presence messages to be submitted immediately, and these are queued until such time as the channel is attached, or the attach fails (or the connection fails). Ably maintains the presence set for each channel, broadcasts enter/leave events to all subscribed clients, and allows clients to query to obtain the set of present clients at any time.

A client that has access to presence state for a channel is passed the current presence state once it attaches.

A client's @clientId@ must be authenticated in order that the client may enter a channel. This means either that the client connects using basic auth (a client in possession of a key can uphold any claimed identity) or using a token that has been issued for that @clientId@.

A given @clientId@ might be present multiple times, via different connections. As far as Ably is concerned these are different members of the presence set. A member of the presence set is, therefore, the combination of a @clientId@ string and a @memberId@ string unique to a connection.

Each member entering a presence channel may include a payload in the @clientData@ attribute of the @PresenceMessage@ and this is then included in the presence updates broadcast to subscribed clients. Clients can update this @clientData@ whilst being members of the channel.

A number of presence actions are therefore defined.

- enter := A clientId, or a clientId/memberId combination, is entering the presence channel.

- leave := A clientId, or a clientId/memberId combination, is leaving the presence channel.

- update := An already-present clientId or clientId/memberId combination has been updated.

The client library does not itself track the presence state of the member it represents; a client may send a @leave@ or @update@ event, for example, without having previously entered via that client instance. This is because that same @clientId@ might have entered the channel on an earlier connection, and the present connection, having inherited from that earlier connection, will adopt that @clientId@/@memberId@ combination.

The Ably service tracks members' presence as clients detach from channels and as connections are dropped, generating @leave@ events as appropriate.

h2. Presence Messages

An Ably Realtime @PresenceMessage@ has an @action@, a @clientId@, and optionally a @clientData@ member carrying a status message or other data associated with the action. As with Message payloads, various primitive and object types are portably defined and supported in all clients, enabling clients to be interoperable across languages and environments.

h3. Presence subscription

<div lang="javascript,nodejs">
A client can subscribe to all presence messages for a channel by passing a listener function to the @subscribe@ method.

<pre lang="javascript,nodejs"><code lang="javascript,nodejs">channel.presence.subscribe(function(message) {
  console.log('presence message received with action ' + message.action);
  console.log('message clientData:' + message.clientData);
});
</code></pre>

Previously registered listeners can be removed.

<pre lang="javascript,nodejs"><code lang="javascript,nodejs">channel.presence.unsubscribe(myListener);
</code></pre>

</div>

<div lang="java">
A client can register for presence messages for a channel by implementing "PresenceListener":#presence-listener and calling the @subscribe(PresenceListener listener)@ method. The listener is passed the new @PresenceMessage@ on each message.

<pre lang="java"><code lang="java">channel.presence.subscribe(new PresenceListener() {
	@Override
	public void onPresenceMessage(PresenceMessage[] messages) {
		System.out.println(messages.length " new presence messages arrived");
	}});
</code></pre>

Previously registered listeners can be removed.

<pre lang="java"><code lang="java">channel.presence.unsubscribe(myListener);
</code></pre>

</div>

h3. Getting channel presence state

A Channel's @presence@ <span lang="default">property</span><span lang="java">field</span> exposes a @get@ method whereby a client can discover the set of all members present on the channel.

bc[javascript,nodejs]. var members = channel.presence.get();
console.log('There are ' + members.length + ' members present');

bc[java]. PresenceMessage[] members = channel.presence.get();
System.out.println("There are " + members.length + " members present");

The client keeps track of the presence set from the time that the channel is attached; a up to date presence set is delivered to the client following attach, and the presence set is updated on each message seen subsequently. Thus this @get@ method synchronously returns the already-known presence set, and does not trigger a new request to the Ably service.

h3. Publishing presence changes

A Channel's @presence@ <span lang="default">property</span><span lang="java">field</span> exposes methods for each of the presence actions whereby a client can publish presence changes.

bc[javascript,nodejs]. channel.presence.enter('I\'m here', function(err) {
  if(err)
    console.log('Unable to publish presence; err = ' + err.message);
  else
    console.log('Presence channel successfully entered');
});

bc[java]. import io.ably.realtime.CompletionListener;
channel.presence.enter("I'm here", new CompletionListener() {
	@Override
	public void onError(ErrorInfo reason) {
		System.out.println("Unable to publish presence; err = " + reason.message);
	}
	@Override
	public void onSuccess() {
		System.out.println("Presence channel successfully entered");
	}
});

An Ably client instance might, if on an application server for example, publish messages on behalf of multiple distinct clientIds. The channel's @presence@ object therefore also supports methods that enable presence messages to be published for a clientId specified at the time of the call, rather than for a clientId specified when the library was instanced.

In order to be able to publish presence changes for arbitrary clientIds, the client library must have been instanced either with a key, or with a token bound to the wildcard clientId.

bc[javascript,nodejs]. channel.presence.enterClient('someClient', 'I\'m here', function(err) {
  if(err)
    console.log('Unable to publish presence; err = ' + err.message);
  else
    console.log('Presence channel successfully entered for someClient');
});

bc[java]. import io.ably.realtime.CompletionListener;
channel.presence.enterClient("someClient", "I'm here", new CompletionListener() {
	@Override
	public void onError(ErrorInfo reason) {
		System.out.println("Unable to publish presence; err = " + reason.message);
	}
	@Override
	public void onSuccess() {
		System.out.println("Presence channel successfully entered for someClient");
	}
});

h3. Retrieving presence history

The @Presence@ API exposes a @history@ method whereby a client can obtain presence updates previously sent on the channel. It provides access to the persisted history, as with the REST API, but also enables access to instantaneous or "live" history for attached channels.

This live history provides the ability to obtain continuous presence history up to the point that a realtime channel was attached and also supports recent history for channels that do not have persistence enabled.

History results are paginated and therefore accompanied with one or more relative links relating to the current query. Where the number of results returned exceeds the query limit - which is either the value of the @limit@ param or the default limit of 100 - the query result contains pages with the limited number of records, and a relative link to the next page.

bc[javascript,nodejs]. var params = {direction: 'backwards', limit: '100'};
channel.presence.history(params, function(err, messages, rel) {
  if(err) {
    console.log('Unable to get presence history; err = ' + err.message);
  } else {
    console.log(messages.length + ' presence messages received in first result');
    if(rel && rel.next) {
      channel.presence.history(rel.next, function(...) { ... });
    }
});

bc[java]. import io.ably.types.PresenceMessage;
import io.ably.types.Param;
import io.ably.types.PaginatedResult;
Param[] params = new Param[] {
  new Param("direction", "backwards"),
  new Param("limit", 100)
};
PaginatedResult<PresenceMessage> messages = channel.presence.history(params);
System.out.println(messages.asArray().length + " presence messages received in first result");
if(messages.getNext()) {
  PaginatedResult<PresenceMessage> nextPage = channel.presence.history(messages.getNext());
  System.out.println(...);
}

See the "history":/realtime/history documentation for further details of the supported query parameters.

  }]</code></pre>

Further details of the paginated response are in the "history API":/realtime/history documentation.
</div>

h2(#presence-message). PresenceMessage

A @PresenceMessage@ encapsulates an individual presence update sent or received in Ably. A presence message has the following members.

- <span lang="java">String</span>clientId := The id of the client associated with the update. This <span lang="default">property</span><span lang="java">field</span> is populated by the system, where the clientId is known, for messages delivered to subscribers. It is not required to populate the clientId of a message before publishing it.

- <span lang="java">String</span>memberId := A unique id for the client associated with the update, to disambiguate in the case that a single clientId is simultaneously present multiple times (eg on different connections). This <span lang="default">property</span><span lang="java">field</span> is populated by the system, where the memberId is known, for messages delivered to subscribers.

- <span lang="java">Object</span>clientData := An optional message payload for a status line or other data associated with the presence update. The data may be one of the supported payload datatypes.

h2(#presence-listener). PresenceListener

<div lang="javascript,nodejs">
A @PresenceListener@ function may be subscribed for all presence messages received on the channel. The message is passed as the first argument to the listener.
</div>
<div lang="java">
A implementation of the @PresenceListener@ interface may be registered to be notified of  arrival of presence messages on the channel. A @PresenceMessage[]@ is passed as the first argument of the listener's @onPresenceMessage@ method whenever a presence message is received on the channel.
</div>

<div lang="java">
h2(#paginated-result). PaginatedResult

A @PaginatedResult@ is an interface that represents the result of a query that supports pagination. An instance of @PaginatedResult@ encapsulates a collection of @PresenceMessage@ objects representing the current page of results, and provides the means - in the form of @Param[]@ to perform queries for subsequent or related pages.

- public PresenceMessage[] asArray() := Returns the current page of results as an Array.
- public List&lt;PresenceMessage&gt; := Returns the current page of results as a List.
- public Param[] getFirst() := Returns the params to pass to a @history()@ call to reproduce the first call in this paginated sequence.
- public Param[] getCurrent() := Returns the params to pass to a @history()@ call to reproduce the current call in this paginated sequence.
- public Param[] getNext() := Returns the params to pass to a @history()@ call to reproduce the next call in this paginated sequence.

</div>
