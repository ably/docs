After setting up the necessary registrations, you can subscribe to your data model. This subscription enables real-time updates whenever there's a change in the data:

```
await model.pause();
// model paused: new events will not be processed and subscription callbacks will no longer be invoked
await model.resume();
// processing of events has resumed and new changes will be made available to subscribers
```

By default, subscriptions operate on an optimistic model, meaning the callback is triggered by any change in the optimistic state or when confirmed changes occur. 

However, if the requirement is to respond exclusively to confirmed changes, specific options can be set during subscription to tailor this behaviour:

```
model.subscribe((err, post) => { /* ... */ }, { optimistic: false });
```
