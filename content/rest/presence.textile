In the REST client library, the current Presence state for a @Channel@ is obtained from an existing @Channel@ object:

bc[javascript]. var Rest = new Ably.Rest(options),
    channel = Rest.channels.get('channel0'),
    presence = channel.presence();

bc[ruby]. rest = Ably::Rest.new(options)
channel = rest.channels.get('channel0')
presence = channel.presence

The presence call in the REST client library directly mirrors the "REST API":/rest-api/#presence.

h6. presence(#presence)

bq. channel.presence(options, callback)

This call queries the REST "@/apps/<app id>/channels/<channel id>/presence@":/rest-api/#presence API.
